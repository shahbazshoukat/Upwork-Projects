var textArray = ["Tom and I walked quietly","along a path among the trees.","When we passed near the","Widow's kitchen, I fell and","made a noise. We lay","very still. Miss Watson's black","slave, Jim, was sitting in","the kitchen door. We could","see him clearly because there","was a light behind him.","He stood up and asked,","\"Who's there?\" Jim stood listening,","then walked toward us.","We didn't make a sound.","Then he stood where Tom","and I were hiding and","asked again, \"Who are you?","I know that I heard something.","I'll just sit here until","I hear the noise again.\"","Jim sat on the ground","between Tom and me.","He leaned against the tree","we were hiding behind.","He almost touched my leg.","My nose began to feel","uncomfortable and I wanted to","rub it, but I dared not.","We sat quietly for a","long time. Then Jim began","to breathe heavily and we","knew that he was asleep.","Very quietly, Tom and I","stood up and walked away.","Then Tom decided that we","would need some candles.","He also wanted to play","a trick on Jim.","I said, \"No, forget the candles.","Jim'll wake up, and then","the Widow will learn that","I'm not in bed.","\"But Tom loved jokes and","he loved danger. He walked","quietly into the kitchen and","took three candles. He left","five cents on the table","to pay for them.","Then he walked quietly to","Jim and took Jim's hat","off his head and hung","it on a tree nearby.","Jim moved a little but","he didn't wake up.","Later Jim said that a","ghost had played a trick","on him and left his","hat on the tree as","a sign. Tom and I","walked quickly into town where","we could see only three","or four lights. Almost everyone","was asleep. Near the town","was a big river, a","mile wide, and very quiet","at this time of night.","Near the river we found","Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and","two or three other boys hiding.","We climbed into a small","boat and traveled two and","a half miles down the","river before we stopped the","boat and went ashore.","Tom led us to some","bushes where he made everyone","promise to keep his secret.","He pushed aside the bushes","and showed us a hole","in the hill. We lit","our candles and used them","to light our way through","the hole and into a","large cave. Soon we came","to a kind of underground","room where we stopped.","Tom said, \"Now we'll start","our club and call it","Tom Sawyer's Club. Everyone who","wants to join has got","to make a promise and","write his name in blood.\"","Everyone was willing to do this.","Tom wrote the program on","a sheet of paper and","read it to us.","All the boys had to","promise that they would never","tell any of the club's secrets.","If they did, other members","of the club would kill","them and would burn their","dead bodies. Some boys thought","that it would be a","good idea to also kill","the families of the boys","who told club secrets.","Tom added this to the promise.","Then Ben Rogers said, \"Huck","Finn doesn't have a family.","How can we let him","join the club?\" \"Well, he","has a father,\" said Tom Sawyer.","\"Yes, he has a father,","but you can never find him.","A few years ago his","father would lay in the","road, drunk from too much","whiskey, but he hasn't been","seen in this town for","more than a year.\"","The boys talked about this problem.","They decided that I could","not join their club.","I became very sad and","felt like crying. Then I","thought of a solution to","my problem. \"Miss Watson can","be part of my family.","You can kill her if","I tell any club secrets.\"","Everyone agreed to this.","I was able to join","the club. Each boy made","a small cut in his","finger with a pin to","get blood to write his name.","\"What will we do in","our club?\" asked Ben Rogers.","\"Oh, kill people and take","their money,\" said Tom.","\"Must we always kill people?\"","\"Oh, certainly. Killing is what","they do in all the","stories that I read,\" said Tom.","\"We have to act just","like they do in books.","The peo­ple who wrote the","books knew the correct way","to do things.\" When that","was decided, Tommy Barnes said","that he wanted to go home.","We said that we would","all go home and meet","again the follow­ ing week.","At that time, we would","plan whom we would steal","money from and kill.","When I got home, I","climbed up onto the porch","roof and in through my window.","My new clothes were wet","and dirty with mud, and","I was very tired.","Miss Watson was very angry","with me in the morning","because of the dirt on","my clothes, but the Widow wasn't.","She was very sad and","unhappy, though, as she cleaned","my clothes. Because I didn't","want her to feel sad,","I promised to be good","and do things to make","her feel proud of me.","Then Miss Watson told me","to pray every day, and","that whatev­ er I asked","for I would get.","But my prayers weren't answered.","I talked to the Widow","about prayers and she said","that my prayers would not","be answered with material things.","She said that I must","pray to help other people,","and that I was never","to think about myself.","I knew that she meant","that I would also have","to pray to help Miss Watson.","I walked out into the","woods and thought about this","for a long time, but","I couldn't see any advantage","in that kind of life","for me-all the advantage would","be for Miss Watson.","I decided not to worry","about praying and being good anymore.","Pap hadn't been seen by","anyone during the previous year,","and that was fine with me.","I didn't want to see","him again. When he wasn't","drunk and could catch me,","he would beat me, though","I tried to hide from","him whenever he came to","our town of St.","Petersburg. Some people told me","that he was found drowned","in the Mississippi River about","twelve miles from town.","They assumed that it was","Pap because the drowned man","was his size and was","wearing torn clothes and had","unusu­ ally long hair.","Not much was left of","his face because the body","had been in the water","a long time. They said","that the body was floating","on its back in the water.","I knew that the body","couldn't have been Pap because","a drowned man doesn't float","on his back; he floats","on his face. The body","had been that of a","woman dressed in men's clothing.","They buried the body before","I got to see it,","but I was frightened knowing","that Pap might soon return","to find me. The boys","in Tom Sawyer's club came","together for meetings but we","didn't really steal money or","kill anyone. We only imagined","that we were killing people","and taking their money.","Tom Sawyer did a lot","of fancy talking, but the","rest of us did very little.","After a while, I tired","of this game. I told","Tom Sawyer that I didn't","find the game fun, and","he said that it was","because I had no imagination.","He said that if I","read more books, I would","know of many famous people","who had good imaginations like his.","Three or four months passed,","and winter arrived. I went","to school almost every day","and was learning to read","and write and spell.","The teacher was also trying","to teach me mathematics, but","I knew even if I","studied forever, I would never","learn mathematics. At the beginning,","I hated school very much,","but after a while, I","hated it less. Whenever I","began to hate school, I","simply stayed away a few days.","The teacher would beat me","when I returned, but the","beat­ ings didn't trouble me.","I had become accustomed to","living in a proper house","with the Widow and sleeping","in a proper bed.","The Widow said that I","would become a good boy","if I continued to study","and to improve my character","and that she was no","longer unhappy with me.","My life seemed to be improving.","Then one morning, while I","was eating breakfast, I poured","some salt on the table.","It was an accident.","I knew that it was","bad luck to acci­ dentally","pour salt and that the","only way to get rid","of the bad luck was","to throw some salt over","my left shoulder. But Miss","Watson stopped my hand and","shouted, \"Take your hands away","from that salt, Huckleberry.","You've already made the table dirty.","Don't make it dirtier.\"","I knew that I couldn't","stop the bad luck;","it would follow me always.","I quickly left the table","and ran out of the house.","I was worried and frightened.","I knew that something bad","was going to happen to","me, but I didn't know","where or when it would happen.","I walked through the front","garden and climbed over a","high fence. Snow was on","the ground, and I could","see tracks made by a","man's shoes in the snow.","The tracks showed that the","man had walked around the","garden fence, but had not","come into the house.","I bent down to look","closely at the tracks and","discovered that the heel of","one shoe had left a","mark that showed that it","had a cross in it","made with two nails.","I knew that someone had","put this cross on the","heel of his shoe to","get rid of bad luck.","I stood up quickly and","was soon running down the hill.","I looked over my shoulder,","but didn't see anyone following me.","I ran to Judge Thatcher's","house as quickly as I could.","\"Hello, Huckleberry, why have you","been running? Did you come","to ask me about your money?","Do you need a few dollars?\"","\"No, sir,\" I answered.","\"Did the bank send you","some money for me?","\"Yes, more than 150 dollars.","That's a large amount of money.","I would like to keep","it for you, together with","your 6,000 dollars. If I","give you all the money","now, you'll only spend it","on foolish things.\" \"I don't","want to spend my money.","I don't even want it ever.","Not even the 6,000 dollars.","I want you to have it.","I want to give all","my money to you.\"","The judge looked surprised.","He couldn't understand what I","was saying. \"What do you mean?\"","he asked. \"Don't ask me","questions, please. Just take the money.","You will— won't you?\"","The judge said, \"I'm puzzled.","Is something wrong?\" \"No,\" I","said, and walked away.","Miss Watson's black slave, Jim,","had a large hair ball","that had been taken from","the stomach of an ox.","Jim thought that the hair","ball had special powers.","He said that it had","the ability to tell what","would happen in the future.","I went to Jim and","told him about the tracks","that I had seen in","the snow. I told him","that I knew that Pap","was in town again because","I knew that he had","made a cross with two","nails in the heel of","his left shoe. I wanted","to know what Pap was","planning to do. Would he","stay in St. Petersburg a","long time? Jim took his","hair ball and said some","words over it. Then he","held it up and dropped","it on the floor.","The hair ball rolled a","short distance. Jim did this","several times, but the hair","ball acted the same each time.","Jim put his ear against","it and listened, but he","heard nothing. He said that","the hair ball would not","talk unless I gave him","some money. I gave Jim","twenty­five cents, and he put","the money under the hair ball.","This time the hair ball","talked to Jim, and he","told me what it said.","\"Your Pap doesn't know what","he'll do. Sometimes he thinks","he'll go away and sometimes","he thinks he'll stay.","The best plan is to","stop worrying and let your","Pap do what he chooses.","You'll have much trou­ ble","in your life, but also","much joy. Sometimes you'll be","hurt and some­ times you'll","be sick, but always you'll","be healthy.\" I returned to","the Widow's house that night.","When I took my lighted","candle and went up the","stairs to my room, Pap","was sitting there. I closed","the door. I turned around,","and there he was.","I expected to be frightened","of him now, but I wasn't.","Pap was nearly fifty years old.","His black hair was long","and un­ combed and dirty.","He had allowed hair to","grow on his face, and","where his skin showed, the","skin was a sickly white.","Just looking at the ugly","white skin made me feel sick.","His clothes?—dirty and torn.","His feet showed through large","holes in his shoes.","His hat was on the","floor—an old black hat with","a large hole in it.","I stood looking at him.","He sat looking back at me.","I put my light­ ed","candle down. I noticed that","the window was open;","that's how he had come","into the room. \"Clean clothes.","New shoes. You think highly","of yourself, don't you?\"","he sneered. \"Maybe I do","and maybe I don't,\" I answered.","\"Don't talk to me in","that tone. You've changed in","many ways since I have","been away. I don't like","these changes. I heard that","you go to school.","You think you're better than","your father because he can't","read and write. Who gave","you permission to go to school?","Answer me.\" \"The Widow gave","me permission. She told me","to go to school.\"","\"The widow? Who gave the","widow permission to tell my","son how to live?","She's not part of your family.","She has no authority to","tell you anything. \"You stop","going to school. I'm your","father, and I don't want","you to be better educated","than I am. I don't","want to find you at","that school again. Your mother","couldn't read and she couldn't","write before she died.","No members of your family","could read or write before","they died. And I don't","want you to be better","than the other family members.","If I see you near","the school again, I'll beat you.\"","He sat there looking angry.","\"I see that you're now","living in a proper house","and are wearing fancy clothes.","You have a good bed","to sleep in while your","father sleeps outside on the ground.","People tell me that you're rich.\"","\"People lie to you.\"","\"Be careful what you say","to me. I've been in","this town for two days","and all the people tell","me how rich you are.","I heard about your money","when I was far away","down the river. That's why","I am here. I want","your money. I want you","to get it for me tomorrow.\"","\"I don't have any money.\"","\"You're telling a lie.","Judge Thatcher has your money.","Get the money from him!","I want it!\" \"I don't","have any money. Please believe me.","Ask Judge Thatcher. He'll tell","you that I have no money.\"","\"I'll ask him tomorrow.","I'll force him to give","me your money. How much","money do you have in","your pocket?\" \"I have only","a dollar, and I want","it to—\" \"I don't care","why you want it.","Give it to me now.\"","Pap took the dollar and","said that he was going","into town to buy whiskey.","Then he climbed out the","open window and onto the","porch roof. I heard him","jump to the ground.","The next day, Pap was","drunk and went to Judge","Thatcher's house. He tried to","force the Judge to give","him my money, but the","Judge refused. Then Pap told","Judge Thatcher that he would","make the law force him.","The Judge and the Widow","went to court and tried","to force the law to","take me away from Pap","and allow me to live","with one of them.","A new judge, who did","not know Pap, had arrived","at the court. The new","judge said that the court","must not separate a child","from his father; so the","Widow and Judge Thatcher didn't","succeed in their plan.","Pap would have authority over","me, though I continued to","live with the Widow.","Pap again went to court","to try to force judge","thatcher to give him my money.","He also tried to stop","me from attending school.","When he saw me going","to school, he would catch","me and beat me.","But I continued to go","to school, and tried to","prevent Pap from seeing me.","I wasn't happy going to","school before, but now I","went because I knew that","it made Pap unhappy.","Some days I would ask","Judge Thatcher for two or","three dollars, which I gave","to Pap. He would buy","whiskey with the money and","get very drunk and start","fights with men in town.","Pap began coming to the","Widow's house to see me.","She told him to stay","away or she would cause","trouble for him. This made","him very angry. He told","her that he had authority","over his son and she","couldn't tell him how he","must act around his son,","what he could and could","not do to me.","The next day, Pap caught","me alone near the river.","He pushed me into a","small boat, and we traveled","three miles up the Mississippi.","We crossed to the Illinois","shore to a place where","there were many trees and","no houses. Pap took me","to a small cabin made","of logs. This cabin was","so hidden in the trees","that no one could see","it from the river.","Pap stayed with me all","the time, and I never","had the opportuni­ ty to","run away. Whenever Pap left","the cabin, he would lock","me inside and take the","key with him. At night,","he slept with the key","under his pillow. He had","a gun, which he had","stolen, and we used it","to hunt ani­ mals for","our food. We also fished","in the river. Every two","or three days, Pap took","some fish to a store","where he traded them for whiskey.","When he returned to the","cabin, he would be very","drunk and would beat me.","I didn't like the beatings,","but otherwise life with Pap","wasn't difficult. I never had","to do any work or","any studying and could smoke","whenever I wished. We spent","most of the time fishing","or just sitting and watch­","ing the river. I never","had to wash or put","on clean clothes and could","sleep whenever I wanted.","We ate our meals when","we were hungry and not","when someone told us to.","Pap stayed away from the","cabin often. Once he stayed","away for three days, and","I was locked inside alone.","I didn't enjoy that.","Whenever Pap returned from a","trip, he would be very","drunk and beat me more","and more. When he was","away for long periods of","time, I began to worry","that he would never return.","What would happen to me?","I could die locked inside","the cabin. I began to","think of a way to escape.","I found an old dirty","saw that Pap didn't know","was in the cabin.","With this tool, I began","to saw a hole through","one of the logs in","the wall behind my bed.","I wanted to make a","hole large enough to climb","through and escape. Making such","a hole was going to","take a long time, and","I worked at it whenever","Pap was out of the cabin.","I kept the saw hidden","while Pap was home.","When Pap would leave, I","pushed the bed away from","the wall and sawed at","the log. When I heard","him returning, I hid the","saw and pushed the bed","back to its normal position.","Pap never knew about the","hole that I was making.","One day, Pap returned from","a trip to the store","feeling very angry. He began","to shout and knock furniture","to the floor. His lawyer","had told him that he","would never be able to","force Judge Thatcher to give","him the money. He also","said that he heard that","the Widow Douglas was again","asking the court to take","me away from him, and","this time the lawyer thought","that the Widow would succeed.","I knew that I did","not want to return to","living with the Widow.","I could never return to","living in a proper house","and going to school.","I had become accustomed to","the type of life that","Pap and I lived and","I didn't want to change again.","Pap said that he would","never allow the courts to","take me away from him.","He would hide me in","another cabin six or seven","miles away, and no one","would ever find me.","I began to worry.","I knew that I had","to escape before we moved","out of our present cabin.","Pap told me to go","to his boat and bring","the food and whiskey that","he had bought at the store.","I carried one heavy load","into the cabin and returned","for a second. I sat","by the boat and thought","about my problem. Where would","I go once I escaped","from the cabin? I began","to make a plan;","I would take Pap's gun","and walk through the forest","as far as I could go.","I would walk mostly at","night and would hunt animals","for food. I would travel","far away, and neither Pap","nor the Widow would find","me again. If Pap drank","a bottle of whiskey and","got very drunk, I would","complete the job of sawing","through the log and could","leave tonight. That was my plan.","I finished unloading the boat","and carried the last of","Pap's things to the cabin.","It was beginning to get","dark and Pap was very","angry because I had taken","a very long time to","unload the boat. He shouted","at me to cook his supper.","Then he drank some whiskey","and began to shout about","the government. \"I hate this","government and I hate its laws.","The law wants to take","my son away from me—my","very own son. I had","all the trouble and all","the worry and all the","expense of raising him, and","now the government wants to","take him away from me.","Now that my son is","old enough to work and","give me money, the government","wants to take that son","away from me. The law","and the courts help Judge","Thatcher to keep my son's money.","I could be a rich","man if the law would","force Judge Thatcher to give","me the 6,000 dollars.","I have to live in","this dirty cabin and wear","old, torn clothes and eat","food that pigs will not","eat, all because the government","won't force Judge Thatcher to","give me my son's money.\"","Pap continued to shout about","the government and the wrongs","that it had done to him.","Finally, he ate the supper","that I had prepared and","drank some more whiskey.","I expected him to be","very drunk and asleep soon,","and then I would steal","his key and unlock the","door and run away.","Pap drank almost a complete","bottle of whiskey, but he","didn't go to sleep.","He shouted and threw furniture","against the walls and made","many loud noises like those","an animal makes, but he","didn't sleep. It was late","at night, and I became","very tired. I could no","longer keep myself awake.","I don't know how long","I slept, but suddenly I","heard a loud scream and","was awake. Pap looked wild","and was running around the","cabin shouting about poisonous snakes","that were attempting to kill him.","He was having a dream,","but I had never seen","him act this wild before.","\"Take the snakes off me!","Take them off! They're biting","my neck!\" Pap screamed and","threw chairs against the wall","and knocked down the table.","He ran around the room,","waving his knife in the","air and threat­ ening to","kill me. He held onto","my jacket and would have","killed me with his knife,","but I slipped out of","the jacket and ran away","before his knife cut me.","Finally, he was too tired","to move. He took a","blanket and wrapped it around","himself and lay on the floor.","He would cry quietly, then","shout, then would cry again.","I had had many bad","experiences with him in the","past, but nothing had ever","been as bad as this.","He finally said that he","was too tired to chase","me anymore. He would sleep","and then would kill me","in the morning when he","felt stronger. I knew that","I had to protect myself.","When Pap was asleep, I","took his gun and sat","with it in my arms.","I would shoot Pap if","he awakened and threatened me","with his knife again.","I didn't sleep again that night.","\"Stand up! Why are you asleep?\"","I opened my eyes and","looked around. I could see","Pap standing over me looking","very angry—and sick, too.","\"Why are you holding that gun?\"","he asked. I knew that","Pap had forgotten all that","had occurred the night before.","I answered, \"Someone tried to","get into the cabin last night.","I took the gun to","protect us.\" \"You should have","awakened me.\" \"I tried.","I really tried. I shook","you, but you continued to sleep.\"","\"Don't stand there talking all day.","Go to the river to","catch some fish for breakfast.","I'm hungry.\" Pap unlocked the","door, and I walked along","the river until I found","a good place to fish.","I noticed many branches floating","on the river. The river","was much deeper than it","was normally and was flowing","much faster. Several large logs","floated down the river.","I became excited. What else","might I find? Suddenly, I","saw an empty canoe floating","on the river. It was","thir­ teen or fourteen feet","long and in excellent condition.","I jumped into the river","and began to swim to","the canoe. When I reached","it, I jumped in and","rowed to shore. At first,","I planned to give the","canoe to Pap to sell","for ten dollars, but when","I reached the shore, I","couldn't see Pap. Then I","had another idea. I would","hide the canoe and use","it to escape. Instead of","walking many miles through the","forest to get away from","Pap, I would use the","canoe to go fifty miles","down the river to a","place where no one would","be able to find me.","I hid the canoe in","a small stream near the","river, and covered it with","tree branches. I knew that","Pap would not be able","to find it. When I","returned to the cabin, Pap","noticed my wet clothes.","I told him that I","had fallen into the river.","Then I cooked the fish","for our breakfast. After breakfast,","Pap said that he would","sleep awhile. I sat and","thought about my escape plan.","I was troubled by one","part of my plan.","I knew that when Pap","discovered that I had escaped,","he would begin to search","for me and I would","always live with the fear","of being found. I needed","to think of a new plan.","Finally, an idea came to me.","This new plan would assure","that no one would search","for me. At noon, Pap","awoke and walked to the river.","He called to me to","say that he saw a","raft made of nine logs","floating down the river.","He wanted to get the","raft because he knew that","he could sell the logs","at the store. We jumped","into our boat and rowed","out into the river.","I seized the rope tied","to the raft and pulled","the raft to shore.","Pap was eager to sell","the logs to buy more whiskey.","He locked me in the","cabin and said that he","would slowly pull the raft","down the river to the store.","I knew that this would","take a long time and","that he would not return","until the following day.","I quickly got my saw","and moved my bed away","from the wall. I soon","finished sawing the hole through","the log wall and climbed","through to freedom. I carried","bags of food from the","cabin to my hidden canoe.","I also took blankets and","dishes and pots and pans","and everything else that I","thought might be useful.","The last things that I","took were Pap's gun and","his ax. Then I pushed","the piece of log back","into the hole. I didn't","want Pap to know how","I had escaped. I took","Pap's gun and walked into","the forest to hunt for","a wild pig. Soon I","shot one and dragged it","to the cabin. With the","ax, I cut a large","hole in the front door.","Then I dragged the pig","into the cabin and cut","its throat. Blood poured out","onto the floor. Next, I","got a large bag and","filled it with rocks.","I dragged this heavy bag","across the cabin floor, through","the door, across the ground","outside the cabin, and all","the way to the river.","I threw the bag into","the river and watched it","disappear in the deep water.","Marks made by the sack","were left on the ground.","Anybody looking at these marks","would think that they were","made by dragging a dead","body over the ground.","Night came and I was","very tired. I sat in","the canoe and waited for","the moon to rise.","I smoked some tobacco and","thought again about my plan.","When Pap returned and found","the cabin empty and blood","over the floor, he would","think that I had been murdered.","He would assume that my","body was dragged across the","ground and thrown into the river.","He might search for my","body for awhile, but he","wouldn't suspect that I was","alive and therefore, wouldn't attempt","to find me. The river","was very wide, nearly a","mile across to the far shore.","The moon was bright now,","and I knew that it","was time to begin my","jour­ ney. I began to","untie my canoe, when I","heard a faint sound on","the river. I knew that","it was the quiet sound","made by a man rowing","a boat. Could Pap be returning?","I had not expected him","until the next day.","The boat came nearer;","it was now close enough","so that I could have","reached out and touched the","man in it. It was Pap!","I could see him in","the moonlight, but he couldn't","see me or my canoe","because I was hidden in","the tree branches that grew","out over the water.","Pap didn't appear to be drunk.","I waited until Pap had","rowed past me, then quietly","moved my canoe down the river.","I stayed close to the","shore so that I would","be hid­ den by tree branches.","When I became too tired","to row, I lay in","the canoe and let it","float gently down the river.","As I lay there, I","smoked my tobacco and looked","into the sky; not a","cloud was in it.","The sky looks very deep","when you lie down on","your back in the moonlight.","I had never known this before.","A person can hear voices","a long distance on such nights.","I heard people talking on","the far shore, and I","could understand every word they spoke.","I heard one man say","that it was three o'clock","in the morn­ ing and","daylight would come soon.","As my canoe floated further","down the river with the","current, the men's voices became faint.","Then all was quiet again.","I sat up and could","see Jackson's Island far ahead","of me. It was in","the middle of the river,","large and dark and with","many trees growing on it.","There were no lights on","the island and no signs","that anyone lived on it.","That's where I planned to live.","I rowed the canoe to","the edge of the island","and hid it under some","tree branches. Then I sat","quietly watching the river.","The sky was begin­ ning","to turn gray. I knew","that the sun would soon","be in the sky.","I found a safe place","under the trees and went","to sleep. The sun was","high in the sky when","I awakened. I lay in","the grass in the cool","shade of some large trees.","I felt very comfortable and","planned to wait before I","cooked my breakfast. While I","lay under the trees, I","heard the distant sound of","a large gun being shot","across the water. I sat","up and listened. I heard","the sound again. Then a","third time. A large boat","filled with people was traveling","on the river. I knew","what they were doing;","they were shooting the large","gun in an attempt to","force my dead body to","float to the top of","the water. I was now","hungry, but it wasn't a","good time to build a","fire to cook my breakfast.","The people on the boat","might see the smoke.","I sat there watching them","for a long time.","The boat passed close to","where I was hiding, and","I could see many people","I knew—Pap, Judge Thatcher, Joe","Harper, Tom Sawyer, Tom's Aunt","Polly, and his brother Sid,","and many more. Everyone was","talking about my murder.","The boat captain shouted, \"Look carefully!","The current flows toward the","island here. The river may","have carried Huck's body to","the edge of the island.\"","All the people on the","boat crowded to one side","and watched the shore.","I stayed hidden. They shot","the big gun, and the","noise made my ears hurt.","The boat floated on and","was soon out of sight","around the island. I could","hear the noise of the","gun further and further away,","and then I didn't hear","the gun anymore. The island","was three miles long.","When the boat came to","the end of the island,","it turned and traveled up","the other side. I crossed","to that side and watched","it travel toward the far","shore, and I knew that","the people were returning to","their homes. I was going","to be safe now;","no one would search for","me again. I carried my","supplies from the canoe to","a place under some large","trees near the center of","the island. There, I made","a tent out of my","blankets and put my supplies inside.","I caught a fish, cleaned","it with my knife, and","cooked it for supper.","When it was dark, I","sat by my campfire smoking","tobacco and feel­ ing well satisfied.","After a while, I became","lonely and walked to the","edge of the island.","I listened to the river","current and counted the stars","in the sky. Then I","counted the logs and rafts","floating down the river.","There's no better way to","spend your time when you","are alone. Soon you lose","that feeling of loneliness.","For three days and nights","my life followed this pattern.","Nothing was different; each day","I did exactly the same things.","On the fourth day, I","explored the island. The whole","island belonged to me, and","I wanted to know everything","about it. I was also","growing bored and needed a change.","I found grapes and other","small fruit to eat.","I carried my gun and","hoped to find an animal","that I might kill for food.","I had walked a long","way and knew that I","must be near the end","of the island. Suddenly, directly","in front of me were","signs of a small camp­ fire.","Smoke was rising from the","burned wood. My heart jumped.","I held my gun tightly","as I slowly backed away.","Quietly, I began the long","walk to my tent.","I would walk a short","distance, then stop to listen.","I was so frightened that","I could hardly breathe.","I knew that another person","was on the island with me.","When I reached my tent,","I quickly gathered all my","supplies and carried them to","my canoe. Then I scattered","the bits of burned wood","from my fire. When I","was satisfied that I had","left no signs of my","camp, I climbed a tall","tree and looked around.","I stayed in the tree","for two hours, but could","neither see nor hear anything.","I couldn't stay in that","tree forever and finally, climbed down.","I stayed hidden most of","the day and listened for","sounds made by the other man.","When it was dark, I","quietly got into my canoe","and traveled to the far","shore near a town.","I was very hungry and","looked for a place to","get some food. Suddenly, I","heard the sounds made by","many horses. The sounds came","nearer, and I could hear","men talking. \"We'll stop here.","The horses are very tired.","We can continue our search","in the morning. We're sure","to find him.\" I didn't wait.","I ran quietly to my","canoe and returned to the island.","No place was safe.","I tried to sleep in","the canoe, but I didn't","sleep much. After a few","hours, I said to myself,","\"You can't live this way.","You have to find the","other person living on this island.\"","Having decided to do this,","I felt better immediately.","I rowed the canoe close","to shore, staying in the","shadows made by the tree","branches that grew out over","the water. The moon was","shining brightly, and outside the","shadows it was nearly as","light as day. I rowed","quietly for an hour.","Nothing else moved except the","river current. When I reached","the end of the island,","I came ashore. I carried","my gun out of the","canoe and walked through the","trees overhead. The moon was","gone from the sky now,","and the sun would soon appear.","I took my gun and","walked quietly toward the place","where I had seen the campfire.","A fire was burning.","I approached it slowly.","There lay a man on","the ground. He was wrapped","in a blanket with his","head toward the fire.","I sat behind some bushes","and watched him. The day","was getting brighter, and the","man slowly sat up.","He stretched his arms, and","his blanket fell to the ground.","The man was Miss Watson's","black slave, Jim! \"Hello, Jim.","Am I glad to see you!\"","I shouted. Jim jumped up","and stared at me wildly.","Then he dropped down on","his knees and put his","hands together and said, \"Don't","hurt me— don't! I've never","done you harm. I've always","liked ghosts and did what","I could for them.","Get back into the river","where you belong.\" I quickly","made him understand that I","was not a ghost and","I was not dead.","I was very happy to","see Jim. I wasn't lonely now.","I talked for a long","time, but Jim sat quietly.","He never said a word.","\"I'll cook our breakfast.","Add more wood to your fire.","We'll need a large fire","for cooking.\" \"What will we cook?","All I've been eating are","some of the fruit that","grows on the island.","Fruit doesn't have to be cooked.\"","\"How long have you been","on the island, Jim?\"","\"I came here the night","your Pap said that you","were murdered.\" \"You've been here","that long time and have","eaten only fruit? You must","be starved.\" \"I'm hungry.","What have you been eating?\"","\"I have a gun and","have been shooting small animals","for food. I'll get my","supplies from my canoe now,","while you put more wood","on the fire.\" After eating","a large breakfast, Jim turned","to me and asked, \"Who","was murdered in that cabin,","and why did your Pap","think that you were dead?\"","I told Jim the whole","story, and he said that","I was very clever, that","even Tom Sawyer could not","have thought of a better plan.","Then I asked, \"How do","you happen to be here, Jim?\"","Jim looked unhappy and said","nothing for a moment.","\"Maybe I shouldn't say.\"","\"Why, Jim?\" \"I have my reasons.","Promise that you won't tell anyone.\"","\"You know I won't tell, Jim.\"","\"I believe you, Huck.","I ran away.\" \"Jim!\"","\"Remember, Huck. You promised not","to tell.\" \"I won't tell, Jim.","People will call me an","Abolitionist and will hate me","for not telling, but I","don't mind. I'll never return","to St. Petersburg again, anyway.","Tell me why you ran away.\"","\"You know I belong to","Miss Watson. She didn't always","treat me well, but she","promised that she would never","sell me down the river","to New Orleans. The city","of New Orleans is as","close to hell as a","black slave can get on","this earth. Last week, I","saw a slave trader talking","to Miss Watson. This made","me feel uneasy. One night,","I listened at an open","door as Miss Watson was","talking to the Widow Douglas.","I heard her say she","was planning to sell me","for 800 dollars and that","I would be sent down","the river to New Orleans.","She said that she hated","to do this, but that","800 dollars was a lot","of money and she needed money.","As soon as I heard","this, I started to run.","I hid in town all day.","I heard people talk­ ing","about how you were murdered,","and I saw them leave","in a boat to search","for your body. When it","was dark, I jumped into","the river and swam to","this island.\" \"And you've had","almost nothing to eat until","I found you.\" \"I couldn't","look for food along the","shore because someone might see me.","I've had to stay hidden","in the bushes during the","day, and all I could","find there was fruit.\"","I wanted to explore the","middle of the island where","I had seen a high hill.","Jim and I had a","difficult time climbing to the","top of the hill because","it was covered with bushes","growing close together. Near the","top, we found a cave","in the rocks. It was","as big as two or","three rooms, and Jim could","stand up straight in it.","Jim suggested that we hide","the canoe and carry the","supplies up to this cave.","If anyone were to come","to the island to search","for him, they would never","find him in the cave.","Also, when it rained, our","supplies would stay dry.","After we moved our supplies","to the cave and built","a fire, we cooked supper.","Then the sky got dark,","and it began to thunder","and lightning. The rain poured,","and I never saw the","wind blow so hard.","It got very dark and","looked blue­black outside. It rained","so hard that we could","barely see the trees.","The wind bent the trees","until they nearly touched the ground.","And when the night was","at its darkest—fst!—it was as","bright as day. The lightning","gave us a quick view","of the treetops bending in","the storm. Suddenly, it was","dark again, and we heard","the thunder crash, and then","roll across the sky.","\"Jim, this is nice,\" I said.","\"I don't want to be","anywhere but here in this","cave with you.\" The big","storm caused the river to rise.","The next day, we saw","that the low places on","the island were flooded.","As we looked across the","river to the far shore,","we saw that parts of","the land there were flooded, too.","We watched many trees and","logs float down the river.","And one lucky night we","caught a section of a","log raft—a very nice raft","12 feet wide and 16","feet long, with a solid,","level floor. Another night, just","before sunrise, we saw a","complete house float down the river.","We rowed out to the","house and climbed in through","the window. We could see","a bed, a table, and","two old chairs, and clothes","hanging against the wall.","There was something lying on","the floor in the far","corner that looked like a man.","Jim called, \"Hello!\" But the","man didn't move. \"He can't","be asleep. He must be dead!\"","Jim went to check.","\"You're right. He's dead.","He's been shot in the back.","He's been dead two or","three days. Don't look at","his face, Huck. It's awful.\"","I didn't look at him,","but I threw some old","clothes to Jim to use","to cover the body.","Then I looked around the room.","There were two dirty dresses","and a woman's hat and","some men's clothing, too.","We took every­ thing of","value we could find—candles, a","cup, a blanket, an ax,","some nails, and a few","other supplies, but most of","the things were torn and","quite dirty. When we left","the floating house, it was","already daylight. I made Jim","lie down in the canoe","and cover himself with the blanket.","If he were to sit","up in the canoe, someone","might notice that he was","black and come to get him.","However, I rowed all the","way back to the island","without seeing anyone at all.","THE FOLLOWING DAY I WANTED","TO TALK ABOUT THE DEAD","MAN AND why he was","murdered, but Jim refused.","He said that talking about","the murder would cause bad luck.","I said no more about","this, but continued to think","about the dead man and","wished that I knew who","had shot him and why.","I searched through the pockets","of the old clothes we","had taken from the floating","house and found eight silver","dollars in an old coat.","I showed the money to","Jim and said, \"You're always","talking about bad luck.","When I showed you the","snakeskin I found yesterday, you","said that touching a snakeskin","would bring me the worst","bad luck in the world.","Do you call this bad luck?","We found all those clothes","and other sup­ plies in","that old house, and now","we have eight silver dollars.","I wish that we had","this kind of bad luck","every day.\" \"Don't make a","joke about bad luck, Huck.","It's coming. Listen to me.","Bad luck is coming.\"","It did come, too.","Four days later, we were","resting on the grass after","eating a large meal.","I went into the cave","to get some tobacco and","found a large, poisonous snake.","I killed it and placed","it on Jim's blanket in","such a way that the","snake appeared to be alive.","I thought that this would","be a funny trick to","play on Jim and was","waiting to see him jump","with fear when he saw","the snake. When it grew","dark, and we returned to","the cave to sleep, I","had forgotten about the dead snake.","While I was lighting a","candle, Jim lay down on","his blanket and suddenly screamed.","He was bitten by a","live snake! He wasn't wearing","shoes and was bitten on","his foot. I felt like","a fool. I had forgotten","that whenever you kill a","snake, a second snake will","come and curl around it.","Jim told me to cut","off the snake's head and","throw it away. Then he","told me to remove the","snake's skin and cook a","piece of its body.","I did that, and Jim","ate what I had cooked.","He said that this would","cure him. I carried both","snakes out of the cave","and threw them as far","as I could into the bushes.","I didn't want Jim to","see two dead snakes and","to discover the trick that","I had played on him.","Jim became very, very sick.","I thought that he was","going to die. The snake's","poison caused his foot and","leg to swell to twice","their normal size. We had","found some whiskey in the","floating house, and I gave","that to Jim to drink.","He was too drunk to","notice the pain in his leg.","After four days and four","nights, the swelling in Jim's","leg began to grow smaller.","He felt less pain and","was able to walk again.","I made a promise to","myself that I would never","again touch a snakeskin.","All Jim said to me","was that he hoped that","I would now believe him","when he spoke to me","about bad luck. When Jim","was no longer sick and","I didn't have to care","for him, I began to","get bored. I was curious","about what was happening in St.","Petersburg. What were they talking about?","Did people continue to talk","about me? I told Jim","that I wanted to return","to the town for a","day or two. Jim liked","the idea, but said that","I would have to go","when it was dark and","that I had to be careful.","He said that no one","would recognize me if I","dressed like a girl, and","I agreed. I rolled up","my trousers and put on","a girl's dress and hat","that we had found in","the floating house. All day","I practiced acting like a","girl until I could do","it quite well. When it","grew dark, I went in","the canoe to the shore","near the far end of town.","I saw a light in","a small cabin that had","been empty for years.","I looked in the window","and saw a woman that","I did not know.","She was a stranger in","this town, which was lucky","for me. I began to","worry that people who knew","me would recognize me even","though I was dressed like","a girl. I decided that","this woman would be able","to tell me all I","wanted to know about what","was being said in the town.","I knocked on the door","and tried to remember that","I was a girl.","\"COME IN,\" SAID THE WOMAN,","AND I DID. \"SIT DOWN.\"","I sat in a chair,","while she looked at me","with shiny eyes and said,","\"What's your name?\" \"Sarah Williams.\"","\"Where do you live?","In this town?\" \"No, I","live in Hookerville, seven miles","down the river. I've walked","from there and I'm tired.","My mother's sick and has","no money, and I've come","to tell my uncle Abner Moore.","He lives in this town,","but I've never visited him.","Do you know him?\"","\"No, but I don't know","everyone yet. I've lived here","only two weeks. It's dark","outside now, and your uncle","must live in the other","end of the town, since","I know the people who","live nearby. I don't think","that it will be safe","for you to look for","your uncle's house in the dark.","My husband will be home","soon, and he can help you.\"","\"I won't need help.","I'm not afraid of the dark.\"","\"Then you must not have","heard about the murder.\"","And she told me all","about how Huck Finn had","been killed and his murderer","had not been caught.","\"Who do people think did","the killing?\" I asked.","\"Most people thought his Pap","murdered him—at least that's what","they thought at first.","But then they changed their minds.","Now they say that he","was murdered by a runaway","slave named Jim. He ran","away the very night that","Huck Finn was killed.","A large reward—300 dollars— will","be paid to anyone who","catches Jim. A reward of","200 dollars will be paid","to anyone who finds Huck's father.","He had come to town","the morn­ ing after the","murder and told about it.","Then he went out on","a boat with many others","to search for Huck's body.","The next day he went","to Judge Thatcher to get","some of Huck's money.","He said that he needed","the money to search for Jim.","The last time he was","seen he was very drunk","and walking with two strangers.","No one has heard from","him since then. Some people","think that he killed Huck","for the money and that","he'll return in a few","weeks and demand what's left","of the 6,000 dollars from","Judge Thatcher.\" \"Why are they","searching for Jim?\" \"Because of","the 300 dollars! That's a","lot of money. Some people","think that Jim hasn't gone","very far. I was asking","some neighbors about Jackson's Island","out in the river.","They told me that no","one lives there. Yet I","know that I saw smoke","from a campfire on the","island two or three times recently.","I think that's where Jim","is hiding. I spoke to","my hus­ band about the","smoke, and he's going over","to Jackson's Island to search","for Jim.\" I became so","worried that I couldn't sit","still and had to do","some­ thing with my hands.","I took a needle off","a table and began to","thread it. My hands were","shaking, and I had trouble","threading the needle. The woman","stopped talking and stared at me.","I quickly put down the","needle and thread and said,","\"Three hundred dollars is a","lot of money. I wish","that my mother could get it.","Is your husband going to","the island tonight?\" \"Oh, yes.","He went to get a","friend to go with him.","They want to borrow a","boat and another gun.","They'll leave tonight.\" \"They could","see better if they waited","until daylight.\" \"Yes, and Jim","will be able to see","better, too. After midnight, he'll","be asleep. They can find","his campfire easily in the dark.\"","\"I didn't think of that.\"","The woman looked at me","in a curious way, and","I felt very uncom­ fortable.","Next she asked me, \"What","did you say your name was?\"","\"M Mary Williams.\" I was","afraid to look at the","woman's face. Had I said","Mary before or had I","said Sarah? \"Dear, I thought","you said that your name","was Sarah when you first","came into the house.\"","\"Oh, I did. My name","is Sarah Mary Williams.","Some people call me Sarah,","and some call me Mary.\"","\"Is that the truth?\"","\"Ya Yes.\" I was feeling","a little better, but I","wished I could leave.","The woman quickly changed the","subject and started telling me","about the problems caused by","rats in their house.","I could see a rat","stick out its nose out","of a hole as she talked.","She kept some rocks on","a table to throw rocks","at the rats. She asked","me to do it for her.","I threw one rock and","hit the rat's hole but","the rat had disappeared.","\"Watch for other rats.","Here's another rock to throw","when you see one.\"","And she dropped the rock","into the skirt of my dress.","I quickly brought my legs","together to catch the rock.","After a few minutes, the","woman looked straight into my","face and said, \"Tell me.","What's your real name?","Who are you?\" \"Wh What?\"","\"What's your real name?","Is it Bill or Tom","or Bob What is it?\"","I was shaking like a","tree in the wind.","I thought a moment before","I spoke. \"Please, don't joke","with me. I'm a poor girl.","If I'm causing you a","problem, I'll leave.\" \"No, you won't.","Sit down and stay where","you are. I'm not going","to hurt you. Just tell","me your secret. I won't","tell anyone. Trust me.","I'll help you. My husband","will help you, too.","Tell me the truth now,","like a good boy.\"","I could see that she","was not fooled by the","girl's dress that I was wearing.","I told her that I","would speak the truth but","that she must keep her","promise not to tell anyone","my secret. I told her","that my mother and father","were dead, and that I","was forced to work for","a mean farmer who lived","about 30 miles from the river.","He beat me and treated","me in a bad way","and I knew that I","had to run away from him.","He was going to be","away from his farm for","a few days, and I","knew that this was the","time to leave. I stole","a dress and hat from","his daughter, so that no","one would recognize me on","the road. I believed that","my uncle, Abner Moore, would","take care of me, which","is why I came to","this town of Goshen to","search for him. \"Goshen?","Do you think that this","is the town Goshen?","This is St. Petersburg.","Goshen is ten miles further","up the river.\" \"Well, if","this is St. Petersburg, then","I must leave. By walking","quickly, I should get to","Goshen in the morning.\"","\"Wait. I'll give you some","food to take with you.","Before you leave, tell me","your real name.\" \"George Peters.\"","\"Remember that name, George.","Don't tell me later that","it is Alexander, and then","that it is George Alexander.","And don't try to be","a girl again. You might","fool a man, but you'll","never fool a woman.","When you thread a needle,","don't hold the thread still","and bring the needle to it.","That's the way a man does.","A woman always holds the","needle still and brings the","thread to it. And when","you throw a rock at","a rat, don't do it","in a skillful manner.","And be sure to miss","the rat's hole by five","or six feet. And when","a girl tries to catch","something in the skirt of","her dress, she throws her","knees apart. She doesn't bring","them together. I realized that","you were probably a boy","when I watched you thread","the needle. I asked you","to do the other things","as a kind of test.","If you ever need a","friend, remember me—Mrs. Judith Loftus.\"","I left quickly and quietly","returned to my canoe, which","was some distance from the","woman's small cabin. I went","as fast as I could","to the island. First, I","ran to my old camping","place and started a large fire.","Then I ran to the","cave and awakened Jim.","\"Hurry. We have no time","to waste. They're after us!\"","Jim asked no questions;","he said not a word.","We loaded all our supplies","onto the raft that we","had found a few weeks before.","We worked in the dark.","Thirty minutes after I reached","the cave, we were ready","to leave. Jim was on","the raft with the supplies,","while I rowed the canoe.","We stayed close to the","island as we traveled, protected","by the tree branches that","grew out over the water.","We soon passed the end","of the island and were","out in the open river","and neither of us had","spoken a word. We tied","the canoe to the raft","with a rope and floated","slowly, very slowly, on the","quiet river. If we heard","anyone following us, we planned","to jump into the canoe","and row for the shore.","We were in such a","hurry to leave the island","that we had not put","any supplies into the canoe.","This was not a good","plan, but we didn't have","the time to think of","a good plan. When the","men came to the island","to search for Jim, I","knew that they would find","the campfire which I built.","They would probably watch it","all night, expect Jim to","return to it. Since we","could hear no one fol­","lowing us, I was fairly","certain that the campfire had","fooled them. In the early","morning, as it was beginning","to get light, we traveled","to the Illinois shore and","tied the raft to a","tree on a sandbar, which","is a long, raised area","of sand extending into the river.","The sandbar was cov­ ered","with tall trees growing close","together and was a good","place to hide the raft","and canoe. We used our","ax to get branches from","the trees to cover the raft.","At this place in the","river, there were mountains on","the Missouri side and nothing","but trees on the Illinois","side, so we felt fairly","safe here. We stayed hidden","in the bushes all day","and watched the rafts and","boats travel down the river","and the huge boats, powered","by steam, travel up the river.","I told Jim the complete","story of my conversation with Mrs.","Judith Loftus the night before.","Jim said that she was","a very intelligent woman, and","if she had gone to","search for him, she would","have brought a dog with","her to help find him.","She would not have sat","by a fire all night waiting.","Toward evening we saw no","boats on the river.","All was quiet. Jim took","some of the boards that","were part of the floor","of the raft and built","a kind of tent with","them in the middle of","the raft. This tent would","pro­ tect us when it","rained and would be a","good place to store our supplies.","We put a layer of","dirt five or six inches","deep within a frame in","the mid­ dle of the tent.","We would be able to","build a fire there on","cold, rainy days. The second","night we traveled for seven","or eight hours, with a","cur­ rent that was moving","fairly fast. We fished and","talked and then went swimming","whenever we felt sleepy.","We were filled with wonder","and a new respect for","nature as we floated down","the big, quiet river.","We lay on our backs,","looking up at the stars","and talking quietly. We didn't","laugh often, and then, only","a quiet kind of laugh.","We had very nice weather","and no problems that first","night or the next or","the one after that.","Each night we traveled past towns.","Some of them were on","top of high black hills.","We could see no houses,","just lights. The fifth night,","we passed the large city","of St. Louis, and the","whole world seemed sud­ denly","one big light. In my","small town, people would say","that 20,000 or 30,000 people","lived in St. Louis, but","I never believed them until","I saw that wonderful spread","of lights at two o'clock","on that quiet morning.","There wasn't a sound;","everyone was asleep. Each night","I would go ashore and","buy a small amount of food.","Sometimes I would take a","chicken or some vegetables from","a farmer's garden. Pap always","called this \"borrowing\" and said","that this should not be","called \"stealing\" if you planned","to return the chicken or","veg­ etables at some later time.","The Widow Douglas said that","this was just plain stealing","and could not be called","anything else, and that no","well­ mannered person would ever steal.","Jim said that Pap was","partly correct and that the","Widow was partly correct, and","that the best plan was","to promise not to \"borrow\"","certain vegetables or fruit, but","that there would be no","harm in continuing to borrow","the others. So, we promised","our­ selves that we would","not borrow any of the","fruit that wasn't ripe at","this time of year.","We both felt better immediately.","Our tenth night on the","river, we had a big","storm after midnight, with much","thunder and lightning. The rain","poured down heavily. We stayed","inside our tent, and no","one guided the raft.","In the bright light of","a flash of lightning, we","suddenly saw a large boat","crashed on some rocks.","We were floating straight toward","the boat. The flashes of","light­ ning allowed me to","see quite clearly now.","The boat was leaning over,","with much of it under","the water. I was excited","at the thought of exploring","this mysterious boat, but Jim","said, \"No!\" He was certain","that a man would be","on the boat to protect","the supplies it carried.","\"What's there to protect?","Most of the boat is","under water. Who would remain","on a boat in that","condition in a storm like this?","At any moment, the boat","might break apart and disappear.\"","Jim couldn't answer that argument","and didn't try. I continued,","\"We might find some good","supplies that we could use.","Boat captains are rich and","always travel with the best supplies.\"","Jim wasn't happy, but he","finally agreed to go with","me on the boat.","A flash of lightning showed","the boat directly in front","of us, and we tied","the raft to a part","of the boat extending above","the water. We found it","difficult to walk on the","deck of the boat because","it was leaning greatly.","We moved very, very slowly,","feeling our way with our feet.","It was so dark that","we could see nothing.","Soon we reached the door","of the captain's cabin, which","was open. We looked around","and far off we could","see a light and hear","some voices. Jim whispered that","he was feeling sick and","that we must return to","the raft immediately. I agreed","and was slowly backing away","from the door, when I","heard a voice say, \"Please, don't.","I promise not to tell anyone.\"","\"You're telling a lie, Jim Turner.","You've done this before.","You always want more than","your share, and you always","got what you demanded because","you threatened to tell.","But this time, you'll not","threaten us again.\" By this","time, Jim had returned to","the raft, but I was","curious about what was happening","in the boat. I said","to myself, \"Tom Sawyer would","stay and listen to what","these men have to say,","and I'll stay, too.\"","I got down on my","hands and knees and moved","slowly toward the room with","the light. I could see","a man lying on the","floor with his hands and","legs tied with ropes.","Two men were standing over him;","one was holding a gun","pointed at his head.","The man on the floor","was saying, \"Please don't shoot, Bill.","I'll never tell anyone.\"","The second man said, \"You","never spoke truer words.","I won't give you the","opportunity to tell anyone.","If we hadn't surprised you","and man­ aged to tie","a rope around your arms","and legs, you would've killed","us both. You won't threaten","us again, Jim Turner.","Put away that gun, Bill.\"","\"Let me shoot him, Jake.","He killed Hatfield and showed","him no mercy. He deserves","to be killed.\" \"Thank you,","Jake,\" said the man on","the floor. \"I'll be grateful","as long as I live.\"","Jake didn't answer him but","motioned to Bill to follow","him out of the room.","I tried to back away","quickly in the dark, but","the deck slant­ ed upward","so greatly that I could","barely move. I hid on","a bed in a near­","by room, seconds before the","two men entered. They talked","seriously and quietly. Bill said,","\"I know he'll tell the police.","I want him dead.\"","\"So do I,\" said Jake quietly.","\"Why don't we shoot him, then?\"","\"Listen to me. Shooting him","could cause us problems.","If we were ever caught,","we would be hanged for murder.","We can take whatever of","value we find on this","boat and hide out on","the shore to wait.","In a few hours, this","boat will sink completely and","Jim Turner will drown.","No one will be able","to blame us for his murder.\"","\"What happens if the boat","doesn't sink?\" \"We can wait","the two hours, can't we?\"","And they left the room.","I hurried as quickly and","quietly as I could to","where we had tied the raft.","\"Quick, Jim, we have to hurry.","We must find the boat","that brought the men here","and untie it. Then all","three of them will be","left here. Get on the","raft and begin the search.\" \"Raft?","What raft? I can't find","our raft. The rope must","have become untied, and the","raft floated away.\" When I","heard Jim's words, I could","hardly breathe. We were caught","on a sinking boat with","a group of murderers!","I had no time to","stand there worrying. We had","to find the boat that","belonged to the three men.","We got down on our","hands and knees and moved","very, very slow­ ly along","the slanted deck. Jim said","that he was too frightened","to move, but I forced","him to continue the search.","After what seemed like a","week, we found their boat.","At that moment, one of","the men appeared and jumped","into the boat. \"Give me","that bag, Bill.\" Bill gave","him the bag and jumped","into the boat, too.","\"We must hurry. This boat","could sink at any moment.\" \"Wait.","Did you look in Jim","Turner's pockets? His share of","the money must be in them.\"","\"I didn't search him.","Did you?\" \"No. We have","to return to get his money.\"","They got out of their","small boat and returned to","the sinking one. Immediately, Jim","and I jumped into their","boat, cut the rope, and","we were off. We didn't","speak or whisper, and we","barely breathed. Soon we lost","sight of the sinking boat","in the dark, and we","knew that we were safe.","Those two men would soon","miss their boat and would","realize that they were in","as much danger as Jim Turner.","Jim began to row the","boat, and I searched the","river for our raft.","Then I began to worry","about those men. What an","awful situation they were in—awful","even for murderers. I began","to feel sorry for those","men and said to Jim,","\"When we see a light,","we'll tie up the boat,","and I'll tell the people","about the sinking boat and","the men on it.","Prison would be a better","place for those men than","drowning in the river.\"","My plan was a good","one, except that we couldn't","find anyone to tell.","And then the rainstorm returned.","We continued down the river","searching for our raft.","After a while, a flash","of lightning revealed a large,","dark object ahead, and we","rowed toward it. We had","found our raft and were","very happy to climb onto","it again. Soon we saw","a light on shore, and","I said that I'd row","the small boat toward it,","while Jim continued floating down","the river on the raft.","He was supposed to go","ashore a few miles further","downstream and build a small","fire, so I could find him.","I surprised a man sleeping","in a boat tied to","the shore. He had left","a light burning and was","supposed to be guarding the boat.","I started to cry and","told the man this story.","\"My father and mother and","sister are in trouble.","If you'll go to them—\" \"Where?","Where are they?\" \"On a","sinking boat up the river.\"","\"Are they on a boat","named the Walter Scott?","That's the only sink­ ing","boat that I know on","the river.\" \"Yes. That's where","they are.\" And I began","to cry again. \"Can you","help them? My uncle lives","in this town and I","know he'll pay you for","your work.\" \"I'll hurry to","find some men to help","me, and then we'll get","your family off that boat.","Are you certain that your","uncle will pay?\" And he","rushed down the street in","the dark to find help.","I quickly returned to my","boat but decided to sit","there until I was certain","that the man had returned","and was on his way","to find the men on","the sinking boat. I would","have liked the Widow to","know the good that I","was doing. I thought that","she would be proud of me.","Suddenly, in the dark, I","saw a black mass float","slowly, silently down the river.","I began to tremble, and","my stomach felt sick.","What I was see­ ing","was the very top of","the sinking boat. Nearly all","of the boat was beneath","the water. I moved close","and called, \"Hello\" several times,","but no one answered.","All was quiet—the quiet of death.","I moved quickly to the","middle of the river, then","started toward the place where","I had asked Jim to","wait for me. By the","time I reached the fire","that Jim had built, the","night was ending and we","found a safe place to","hide our raft. We were","very tired and could finally sleep.","WHEN WE AWOKE, JIM AND","I EXAMINED THE SUPPLIES THAT","WE FOUND in the small","boat belonging to the three men.","We found heavy shoes, blankets,","clothes, books, tobacco—all kinds of","things that the men had stolen.","Neither Jim nor I had","ever owned this much before.","We sat all afternoon, talking.","I told Jim what I","had heard inside the sinking","boat and how we had","had a real adventure like","those in books. Jim said,","\"I would rather live without adventure.","When I found the raft","missing, I thought that it","was the end for old Jim.","If no one saved me,","I would be drowned, and","if someone did save me,","I would be returned to","Miss Watson for the reward","money, and she would sell","me down the river to","New Orleans.\" Well, Jim was","right, but then he was","almost always right. Jim cer­","tainly understood a lot about","people and what made them","act the way that they do.","He had a good mind.","I read to Jim from","one of the books that","we found in that boat.","I read about kings and","dukes and the fancy clothes","that they wore and how","they called each other \"Your","Majesty\" instead of just plain mister.","Jim was very interested.","He said that he did","not know about kings, he","knew only about King Solomon","in the Bible. \"The Bible","says that King Solomon was","the wisest man who ever","lived, but he had many,","many wives and I don't","think that was so wise.","Think of all the talking","and the noise. And remember","the time that two women","came to him and each","claimed to be the mother","of the same baby.","What does King Solomon say?","He says that he'll cut","the baby into two pieces","and give each woman a piece.","Now what can a woman","do with half a baby?","Do you think that was wise?\"","\"But Jim, you don't understand","what King Solomon was doing.\"","\"Don't tell me that I","don't understand. I have common","sense, and common sense will","tell you that you can't","settle an argument about a","whole child with half a child.\"","\"But Jim, King Solomon knew","that the baby's real mother","wouldn't allow him to cut","the baby in two.\"","\"You're wrong, Huck. King Solomon","had so many, many children","that one more meant little","to him. He didn't value","the baby the way a","man would who has only","one or two.\" I knew","that I could never reason","Jim about King Solomon, so","I changed the subject to","French kings. I told him","about King Louis XVI who","had his head cut off","France many years ago and","about his son, the Dolphin,","who was supposed to become","king but was put in prison.","Some said that he died","in prison, but others said","that he escaped to America.","\"What would the Dolphin do","in America? There are no","kings here.\" \"Well, he could","teach people to talk in","French,\" I answered. \"What do","you mean, Huck? Don't the","French people talk the way","Americans talk?\" \"No, Jim.","You wouldn't understand a single","word spoken by a Frenchman.\"","\"Why, Huck? It makes no","sense for a Frenchman to","speak in a different language.","He should talk so that","everyone could understand him.\"","\"Listen, Jim. Does a cat","talk like we do?\"","\"No, a cat does not.\"","\"Does a cow talk like us?\"","\"No.\" \"Does a cat talk","like a cow or a","cow talk like a cat?\"","\"No, they don't.\" \"Then it's","natural and correct for a","cat or a cow to","talk different from us and","different from each other.","Do you agree?\" \"Certainly, Huck.\"","\"Then why should it not","be natural for a Frenchman","to talk in a language","different from the one we speak?\"","\"Is a cat a man, Huck?","Is a cow a man?\"","\"Well, no.\" \"Then, of course,","a cat or a cow","won't talk like a man.","But is a Frenchman a man?\"","\"Well, yes.\" \"Then why can't","he talk like a man?","Answer that.\" I knew that","I was wasting my words.","I could never win in","this kind of argument with","Jim, so I quit.","Jim and I planned to","travel to the city of","Cairo, at the south ern","tip of Illinois. The Ohio","River joins the Mississippi River","at Cairo. We planned to","sell our raft there and","use the money to pay","to travel north on the","Ohio River to the Free States.","Once Jim reached the Free","States in the North, he","would be a free man","and would not have to","worry about being sold ever again.","We figured that it would","take us three more days","to reach Cairo. On the","second night, a heavy fog","surrounded us. We couldn't see","where we were traveling in","the fog and had to stop.","I took hold of a","rope tied to the raft,","got into the canoe, and","started moving toward shore.","I could find only a","small tree to tie the","rope around. The cur­ rent","was very strong, and soon","the raft pulled the tree","out of the ground and","went racing down the river.","I was shocked. In half","a minute, Jim and the","raft were lost in the","thick fog. I tried to","untie my canoe, but my","hands were shaking. Finally, I","began following after the raft,","but I was soon lost","in the thick, white fog.","I didn't know which direction","to row; therefore, I simply","allowed the current to carry","me downstream. I shouted to","Jim, and from faraway came","Jim's answer. I went toward","the sound of Jim's voice.","The next time Jim shouted,","he was again far away,","and again I tried to","reach him. Sometimes it seemed","that Jim was to the","left of me, while at","other times he seemed to","be on the right.","Then all was quiet.","I called out to Jim","many times but heard noth­ ing.","I was puzzled because I","seemed too close to a","shore, yet I knew that","I was traveling near the","middle of the river.","Then I understood what had happened.","I was not along the","shore of the river, but","along the shore of a","large island in the river.","I saw some dark forms","in the fog, which were","large trees. This meant that","the island was very large.","I was traveling on one","side of the island, while","Jim was traveling on the","other side. Often my canoe","hit against logs and trees","floating down the river.","I knew that Jim was","having the same problem on","the raft. After a long","while, I was traveling in","the open river again.","I called to Jim again","and again, but heard nothing.","I knew that the raft","must be caught against some","logs or floating trees.","I was certain that I","would never see Jim again.","I could think of nothing","more I could do, and","I lay down in the","canoe and fell asleep.","I must have slept a","long time, for when I","awoke the fog had disappeared","and there were stars in","the sky. The river was","very wide here, and huge","trees grew on both shores.","I looked for the raft","and thought that I saw","it far ahead. I went","as fast as I could,","but when I reached the","dark spot that I thought","was the raft, I found","only a large tree floating","on the water. For the","next hour, I moved toward","many other dark spots on","the river, but each time","I found only floating trees.","Finally, I found the raft.","Jim was asleep on it.","Part of the raft had","been broken by the force","of the river current, and","branches and pieces of dirty","wood covered the deck.","I tied my canoe to","the raft and lay down","beside Jim. I stretched my","arms and acted as though","I were simply awakening.","\"Hello, Jim. I've been asleep.\"","\"Is that you, Huck?","You aren't dead? You aren't drowned?","I can't believe that you're alive.","Is this really you?","I'm so happy. I didn't","expect to see you ever again.\"","\"Why are you talking like","that, Jim? Are you drunk?\" \"Drunk?","I never had time to drink.\"","\"Then why are you talking","in this crazy manner?","Why are you talking as","though I've been away?\"","\"Huck—Huck Finn, look into my","eyes and tell me that","you have been on this","raft this entire night—that you","never left the raft.\"","\"Left the raft? Why would","I have left the raft?","Where would I have gone?\"","\"Huck, do you remember tying","the rope from the raft","to that small tree when","we were in the thick fog?\"","\"What small tree, Jim?","And what fog? What are","you talking about?\" \"I'm talking","about the fog that was","here most of the night.","I'm talking about how we","were separated—you were in the","canoe and I was on","the raft, and my raft","was nearly destroyed when it","struck some big logs being","pushed by the river current.\"","\"You must have been dreaming, Jim.","That didn't happen. There was","no fog, and we were","never separated. I've been sitting","on this raft talking to","you all night, until you","went to sleep.\" \"But how","could I have dreamed all that?","That makes no sense.\"","\"Well, you must have dreamed","it because I've been sitting","here on the raft and","never left it.\" Jim rubbed","his hand over his face.","\"If that was a dream,","Huck, that was the strangest","dream I ever had.","That dream must have been","sent to me as a warning.","If we are going to","prevent bad luck, we must","understand exactly what each part","of the dream means.","That dream tried to tell","me that we were going","to meet much trouble and","have many problems with bad","people, but if we are","careful and are nice to","people who are mean to","us, we'll finally come out","of the fog and have","no more problems and will","end in the big, clear","river, which represents the Free","States of the North, where","I'll finally be a free man.\"","\"That sounds fine, Jim, but","how do you explain all","these branches and pieces of","dirty wood on the deck","of the raft? How do","you explain that part of","the raft that is broken?\"","Jim looked at me, then","at the broken part of","the raft and the dirty","wood on the deck, then","he looked at me again.","He never smiled, but had","the saddest look on his","face that I had ever seen.","\"I'll tell you how I","explain them, Huck. After I","made my throat sore from","calling and calling to you","in the fog, and after","searching for you until I","thought that I wouldn't be","able to move another muscle","again, I began to cry.","I knew that you were","drowned and I would never","see you again. In that","condition I went to sleep.","When I awoke and saw","you safe in the raft,","I was so happy that","I wanted to get down","on my knees and kiss","your feet. But what were","you thinking? Only how you","could trick old Jim and","make him seem to be","a fool. The branch­ es","and dirty wood on this","raft are worthless, and a","friendship is worth­ less if","the friend plays a trick","like the one you played.","What you did is shameful, Huck.\"","Jim stood up and slowly","walked into the tent.","He said nothing more, but","what he had said was","enough to make me feel","deep shame. I wanted to","kiss his feet and have","his friendship again. It was","fifteen minutes before I went","in to tell Jim that","I was sorry about the trick.","I was always happy that","I told Jim how sorry","I felt, and I never","again played an unkind trick","on him. We slept most","of the day and started","traveling again that night.","We talked about Cairo and","wondered if we would recognize","it when we reached it.","I said that we might","not recognize it in the","dark because I had been","told that it was a","small town with no more","than a dozen houses.","Jim said that we would","surely be able to recognize","where a river as large","as the Ohio River joined","the Mississippi. I wasn't cer­","tain about this. Jim began","to worry, but then he","thought that he would surely","feel different when we were","near Cairo because he would","then be a free man.","If we missed Cairo, we","would be in slave country","again and he would have","lost his one chance to","be free. Each time Jim","saw even a small light,","he began to tremble with excitement.","He knew that he was","very close to being a","free man. Suddenly, I began","to tremble as I listened","to him talk, for I","realized that he was almost","free, and who was responsible","for that? I was.","And that thought troubled me.","I had never really thought","clearly about what I was","doing, but now I worried","about it more and more.","I did not really steal","Jim from Miss Watson, but","I knew that he was","running away from her and","that I should have told","someone—I should have stopped him.","Miss Watson had never done","me harm. She taught me","to read; she tried to","teach me manners. Why was","I helping her lose property","that was worth 800 dollars?","Jim talked out loud about","freedom, while I worried silently","and tried to decide what","I should do. Jim said","that the first thing that","he would do when he","was a free man in","a Free State was work","and save every cent of","his money until he had","enough to buy his wife","out of slavery. Then they","would both work until they","could buy their two children,","or maybe they would get","Abolitionists to steal the children","for them. I became sick","with guilt when I heard","Jim say those words.","He would never have dared","talk of stealing his children","before and was saying that","now only because he felt","he was almost free.","I was helping Jim run","away and he was talking","about stealing his children—children who","belonged to a man that","I had never met, a","man who had never done","me harm. I was sorry","to hear Jim say those words;","it was such a lowering","of himself. I felt so","guilty that I told myself","that I would go to","shore the first time I","saw light and tell someone","about Jim. I knew that","was the correct thing to do.","I felt much better.","After some time, Jim called","out, \"We're safe. I see","a light and that means","we have reached Cairo.\"","\"I'll get into the canoe","and go to see if","we are in Cairo.","You could be mistaken.\"","Jim got the canoe ready","and put his old coat","in the bottom for me","to sit on. As I","began to row, he said,","\"Soon I'll be shouting for joy.","I'll owe my freedom to","you, Huck. I'll never forget you;","you're the best friend I've","ever had. And you're the","only friend I have now.\"","I was rowing quickly, eager","to tell someone that Jim","was a run­ away slave,","but when I heard Jim's","praise of me, I slowed","my rowing down. What should","I do? I no longer knew.","Jim shouted, \"There goes my","good friend, Huck, the only","white man who ever kept","his promise to old Jim.\"","My stomach felt sick when","I heard those words.","At that moment, a boat","approached with two men in","it, each holding a gun.","I stopped. One of the","men asked, \"Is that raft yours?\"","\"Yes, sir.\" \"Are there any","men on it?\" \"Only one, sir.\"","\"Five black slaves ran away","tonight from a man who","lives further up the river.","Is your man white or black?\"","I tried to answer, but","the words would not come.","I knew what I had","planned to say, but I","was weakening. \"He's white.\"","\"We'll go to your raft","to check for ourselves.\"","\"I wish you would,\" I","said quickly. \"My Pap is","on the raft, along with","my mother and sister.","They are all very sick","with a serious disease that","has caused many people to die.","No one else has wanted","to come near them.","Everyone has been frightened about","getting the disease.\" The men","stopped rowing. I started to cry.","\"Please, help my family.","They'll all die. Don't leave","like all the others have.\"","\"We're sorry to learn about","your family, but we don't","want to get sick.","Other men will be along soon.","Ask them for help but","don't tell them about the","sickness in your family.","Just stay away from our boat.","I'll float a twenty dollar","gold piece to you on","a board. I hate to","leave you but the money","should help.\" The second man","said, \"Let me add a","second twenty dollar gold piece","to that board. I hope","your family will get better.","And if you see any","runaway slaves, get help and","catch them. We earn a","lot of money catching runaway slaves.\"","\"Good­bye, sirs,\" said I.","\"If I see any runaway","slaves, I'll catch them.\"","After they left, I returned","to the raft feeling sad;","I knew that I had","done wrong. But then I","said to myself, \"Suppose I","had done the right thing","and told the men about Jim.","Would I feel better now?","No, I would feel just","as guilty as I do now.","Whatever I do, I'll feel guilty.","I'm going to stop worrying.\"","I entered the tent on","the raft, but Jim wasn't there.","I looked every­ where and","could not see Jim.","I called out, \"Jim.\"","\"Here I am, Huck.\"","Jim was in the river,","with just his nose above","the water. I told him","that the men were gone","and he could return to","the raft. \"I listened to","what you said to those","men, Huck. That was a","clever trick.\" I gave Jim","one of the twenty dollar","gold pieces and he said","that was enough money to","pay for our boat trip","up the Ohio River to","free­ dom. He thought that","we were within twenty miles","of Cairo, but the night","was ending and we had","to find a place to","hide the raft. We spent","the day wrapping our supplies","in blankets and tying them together.","We had everything prepared for","leaving the raft. That night","we saw lights from a","town, and I rowed the","canoe to shore to ask","the name of the town.","I met a man fishing","from his boat and asked,","\"Is this the town of Cairo?\"","\"Cairo? No. You must be","a fool.\" I returned to","the raft. Jim was very","disappointed, but I said that","I was certain Cairo would","be the next town.","We passed another town just","before daylight. The town was","built on some high hills,","but Jim said that the","country around Cairo was very flat.","We sat through the whole","day without talking much.","We both knew that something","was wrong. We should have","reached Cairo by now.","Finally I said, \"Maybe we","passed Cairo in the fog","at night.\" \"Don't talk about","it,\" said Jim in the","saddest voice that I have","ever heard. \"I've never had","good luck. I suspect that","snakeskin is still working its","bad luck on us.\"","\"I wish that I'd never","touched that snakeskin, Jim.","I wish that I'd never","seen it.\" \"Don't blame yourself, Huck.","You didn't know that snakeskins","bring bad luck.\" We talked","about the problem. We knew","that we couldn't turn the","raft around and travel up","the river because a raft","travels with the river current—all","rafts travel downstream only.","All we could do was","wait until dark, leave the","raft forever, and row the","canoe up the river to Cairo.","We slept all day hidden","in some bushes so that","we wouldn't be tired for rowing.","When we returned to the","raft, the canoe was gone!!","Neither of us spoke.","We knew that this was","more bad luck sent to","us by the snakeskin.","We knew that we now","had no other choice.","We had to continue traveling","South, deeper into slave territory.","I told Jim that I","would buy a canoe with","my twenty dollar gold piece","just as soon as I","found some­ one who would","sell a canoe to me.","The night was very dark;","no moon or stars were","in the sky. It was","the worst kind of night","for traveling, almost as bad","as traveling in the fog.","Suddenly, we saw a huge","boat coming toward us.","I quickly put a light","on our deck and hoped","that the captain would see it.","At the last moment, before","the boat hit us, we","heard the captain shout.","Jim and I both jumped","into the river. I could","hear the crash of the","big boat against our raft.","I stayed very deep in","the water because I knew","that I could be killed","by the huge water wheel","that powered the boat.","The huge boat continued up","the river; the captain never","stopped to see if we","were hurt. I called to","Jim, but heard no answer.","I was able to hold","onto a float­ ing log,","and swam with it to shore.","The river was very wide,","and it took a long","time before I reached the shore.","I had no idea where","I was, but I could","see a large house nearby.","I had planned to walk","quietly past the house without","awakening anyone, but a large","group of dogs ran from","the house, barking and showing","their teeth, and I knew","that I had to stand quietly.","A man's head appeared at","a window and he shouted,","\"Who are you?\" \"It's me—George Jackson.\"","\"What do you want?\"","\"Nothing, sir. I want to","walk past your house, but","your dogs won't allow me.\"","\"Why are you outside so","late at night?\" \"I fell","into the river from the","deck of that large boat","you may have seen.","I'm only a boy.","I don't intend to harm anyone.\"","I heard him shout to","his wife. \"Bring me a","light and wake Bob and Tom.","Tell them to get their guns.\"","Then to me, he said,","\"Is there anyone with you?\"","\"No, sir, nobody.\" \"George Jackson,","do you know the Shepherdsons?\"","\"No, sir. I never heard","of them.\" \"You may be","telling the truth or you","may be lying. Step forward slowly.","If there's anyone with you,","he'll be shot. Slowly, open","the door and step into","the house.\" I was very frightened.","I couldn't have moved quickly","even if I dared.","The dogs were quiet.","Not a sound was made","by anyone. All I could","hear was the beating of","my heart. I walked up","three steps to the door","and heard someone unlocking it.","Slowly, I opened the door","a lit­ tle, then a","little more. I heard a","man's voice say, \"That's far enough.","Put your head inside.\"","I did, but fearing someone","would shoot my head.","I saw a lighted candle","on the floor. Three big","men holding guns stood looking","at me. The oldest man","was perhaps sixty; the two","younger men were in their","thirties—all of them were handsome,","fine­looking people. Then I noticed","the sweetest, gray­haired lady, and","behind her stood two younger women.","Finally, the oldest man said,","\"Come in.\" As soon as","I was inside the house,","the old man locked the","door with several locks.","The younger men kept their","guns pointed at me, while","we all walked into a","large room that had few windows.","They looked at my face","closely, and then they all","said, \"He's not a Shepherdson.","He looks nothing like any","of the Shepherdsons.\" The oldest","man said that he hoped","that I didn't think that","they had bad manners, but","that they had to be","very careful. He asked me","to tell them about myself.","The gray­haired woman interrupted him","and said, \"Saul, the poor","boy is completely wet and","he's probably hungry. Send someone","to awaken Buck and tell","him to dress the boy","in some of his dry clothes.\"","When Buck appeared, I could","see that he was a","boy of about my own","age—thirteen or fourteen—though he was","bigger than me. He stood","in the room looking very sleepy.","His mother told him to","take me to his room","and give me some dry","clothes to wear. After Buck","gave me a clean shirt","and trousers, he asked, \"How","long will you stay with us?","I want you to live","with us. I want you","to be my friend.\"","When we returned to his","family, they had a breakfast","prepared for me. Buck and","his mother and all the","men smoked tobacco and talked,","while I ate and talked.","They asked me about my","life, and I told them","that my family was living","on a small farm in","the State of Arkansas, and","that my sister Mary Ann","had run away to get married.","My brother Bill left to","look for her and was","never heard from again.","My brothers Tom and Mort","died, and no one remained","in the family but my","father and me. He became","so sick worrying about the","disappearing family, that he, too, died.","The farm didn't belong to","our family, and I left","and started traveling up the","river until I fell off","the large boat. They told","me that I could live","with them—that I could share","a bed with Buck.","I was happy to hear this.","They were a nice family,","and the house was beautiful.","I had never seen such","a fine house before.","All of the furniture was","of the latest style.","I knew that they had","spent much money furnishing the house;","all of their dishes were","of the best quali­ ty.","They owned many books, too,","and fine paintings. All the","windows had lovely curtains, and","they had a piano in","the living room. The two","daughters played the piano and","sang songs in the evening.","That house had everything a","person could want, and the","food was good, too.","Colonel Grangerford was a gentleman,","a complete gentle­ man.","He and his family were","members of the upper class","of the South. In our","town, the Widow Douglas was","thought to be a member","of the upper class, while","Pap was from the very","lowest class. But the Granger­","fords were members of a","much higher class than the Widow.","Colonel Grangerford was very tall","and very thin and kept","him­ self neat and clean.","He dressed in a clean","white shirt and wore a","com­ plete suit with a","jacket every day of his life.","His suit was made of","white material—the white was so","bright and clean that my","eyes hurt just to look","at it. He never spoke","in a loud voice and","was the kindest man that","I have ever met.","He never had to remind","his family about good man­ ners;","everyone was always good­mannered when","he was near. When Colonel","Grangerford and his wife arrived","at the breakfast table in","the morning, the other family","members stood up from their","chairs and said, \"Good morning.\"","Bob was the oldest son,","and Tom next—tall, beautiful men","with very broad shoulders, black","hair, and black eyes.","They dressed in pure white","suits, like their father's, and","wore expensive hats. One sister's","name was Charlotte. She was","twenty­five, and was tall and","proud and beautiful. Her sister,","Sophia, was twenty, and kind","and gentle and sweet.","Each member of the family","had a black slave to","work for him. I was","given a black slave, too,","but he didn't have much","work to do since I","wasn't accustomed to having a slave.","These were all the people","who remained in the family","then, but the family had","once been larger. Three sons","had been killed and a","daughter, Emmeline, had died.","The Colonel owned many farms","and more than one hundred","black slaves. The Grangerfords had","many cousins living on nearby farms.","The cousins would visit for","five or six days, during","which the Grangerfords would give","parties for them and picnics","and dances. The men who","came to visit always brought","their guns with them.","There was another upper­class group","of families named Shepherd­ son","living in the same area.","The Shepherdsons were as rich","and as grand as the","Grangerfords, and their houses were","equally splendid. One day, as","Buck and I were hunting","with our guns, we heard","the sounds of a horse approaching.","\"Quick! Hide!\" whispered Buck.","We hid behind some bushes","and watched a handsome young","man ride by on his horse.","He was carrying a gun.","I recognized Harney Shepherdson!","I heard Buck's gun shoot,","and Harney's hat fell to","the ground. Harney aimed his","gun straight at the place","where we were hiding, but","we were already running back","to the Grangerford house.","Colonel Grangerford looked happy when","we told him the story,","although he said that he","did not like for Buck","to shoot from behind a bush.","\"You should have stepped out","into the road when you","shot at him.\" As soon","as I was alone with","Buck, I asked him, \"Did","you want to shoot Harney?\"","\"I certainly did.\" \"Has Harney","ever attempted to harm you?\" \"No.","He's never hurt me.\"","\"Then why did you want","to kill him?\" \"Because of","the feud.\" \"What's a feud?\"","\"I'll tell you what the","word feud means. A man","has a quarrel with another","man and kills him.","The dead man's brother then","kills the mur­ derer.","Then other brothers in both","families have been killed.","That's what's called a feud.\"","\"When did your family's feud","with the Shepherdsons begin?\"","\"More than thirty years ago.","There was trouble about something,","and the problem was taken","to a court of law.","One man wasn't happy with","how the problem was settled","and he shot and killed","the other man.\" \"What was","the trouble about, Buck?\"","\"I have no idea.\"","\"Well, which family began the shooting?\"","\"That was so long ago","that I don't know.\"","\"Have any men been killed","this year, Buck?\" \"Yes, we","killed one and the Shepherdsons","killed one. About three months","ago, my fourteen­year­old cousin, Bud,","was riding his horse on","the other side of the river.","He didn't have his gun","with him. Old Baldy Shepherdson","met him and chased him","for five miles before he","shot him dead. By the","end of the week, one","of the Grangerford cousins had","killed old Baldy.\" The following","Sunday, we attended a church","service three miles away.","The men, including Buck, took","their guns with them and","sat in church with guns","in their arms. The Shepherdsons","attended the same church, and","their men, also, sat holding guns.","The minister talked about brotherly","love and faith and doing","good works. I thought that","this was one of the","worst Sundays that I had","ever lived through, but the","Grangerfords enjoyed what the minister","had to say and talked","about brotherly love on the","way home. After we had","eaten Sunday dinner, the men","sat sleeping in their chairs,","while Buck and his dog","lay stretched out in the","sun asleep. I always considered","Sunday the dullest day of","the week. I decided to","go to my room to","sleep, when Miss Sophia motioned","for me to come into","her room. She closed her","door softly and asked me","if I would do some­-thing","for her and not tell anyone.","I said that I would.","She then told me that","she had left her Bible","in church that morning and","wanted me to get it","for her. I walked to","the church without being seen","and soon found Sophia's Bible.","I knew that something was","wrong because it wasn't normal","for a girl to be","so eager to have her Bible.","I shook the book and","a piece of paper fell out.","On the paper were written","the words, \"Half­past­two.\" Nothing else.","Half­past­two must mean a time","of day, 30 minutes after","the hour of two o'clock.","I could figure nothing more","from the note, so I","returned it to the Bible","and hurried to Miss Sophia.","Miss Sophia was waiting for","me in her room.","She took the Bible and","shook it until the paper","fell out. As soon as","she read it, she looked happy.","Again she asked me not","to tell anyone. Her face","turned red for a few","minutes and her eyes seemed","to shine. I asked her","what the message on the","paper meant, and she said","that it was nothing, only","a book mark to keep","her place in the Bible.","She then told me to","go away and play.","I walked to the river,","thinking about that message, and","soon noticed that my black","slave was following me.","When we were out of","sight of the house, he","came to me and said,","\"If you come up the","river with me a short","distance, I'll show you a","nest of dangerous snakes.\"","There's something strange about this,","I thought to myself.","He told me about that","nest of dangerous snakes yesterday, too.","He should know that I","don't have a love for","dangerous snakes and I don't","go hunting for them.","I wondered about his real","purpose and said, \"Show me","the way.\" I followed him","for a half mile along","the river. Then we walked","over another half mile of","land that was partly covered","by water. We came to","a small flat piece of","land that was dry and","covered with trees and bushes,","and he said, \"Walk in","there a few steps.","That's where the snakes are.","I've seen them before and","don't want to see them again.\"","Then he left. I pushed","aside some of the bushes","and saw an open area","that looked almost like a","room in a house.","A man was lying there asleep.","It was my old friend Jim!","I awakened him and expected","him to be very surprised","to see me. He was","very happy, but not surprised—he","said that he knew all","about what I'd been doing.","The Grangerford slaves had found","him and showed him this","place to hide. They brought","him food every day and","told him what I was doing.","\"You should have sent for","me sooner. I thought that","you had drowned. Why did","you wait to let me","know you were safe?\"","\"I wanted to repair the","raft first.\" \"What raft?\"","\"Our old raft.\" \"I thought","our raft was destroyed when","we were hit by that","large boat.\" \"Parts of it","were damaged, but I was","able to repair the damage.","We lost most of our","supplies, but I've been buying","new pots and pans and","other supplies.\" \"How did you","find the raft?\" \"The slaves","found it and told me","about it. I bought it","from them. They were happy","to get the money.\"","I don't want to talk","much about the next day.","I awakened very early and","noticed that the house was","very quiet. Buck was not","in bed beside me.","I ran outside and asked","my black slave where the","Grangerfords had gone. \"Don't you know?\"","\"No, I don't know anything.\"","\"Miss Sophia ran off in","the night to get married","to Harney Shepherdson. When the","family learned about it a","short while ago, they all","rode off on their horses","carrying guns. They say that","they'll shoot Harney Shepherdson before","he can cross the river","with Miss Sophia.\" I started","running along the river road","as fast as I could.","I could hear guns at","a distance. When I got","near the store, I could","see four or five men","on horses screaming to some","boys who were hiding behind","a woodpile. I climbed up","into a tree to be","able to see better.","The boys behind the woodpile","shot one of the men","on horseback. The other men","jumped off their horses to","help the wounded man.","That gave the boys time","to run, but the men","were soon after them.","I suddenly realized that the","boys were Buck and his","cousin Joe. They ran behind","a woodpile that was beneath","my tree. I called to","Buck, and he was sur­","prised to see me.","He said that he and","his cousin would kill some","Shepherdsons before the day was ended.","His father and his two","broth­ ers were already killed.","I asked him what had","become of Harney and Miss","Sophia, and he said that","they had gotten safely across","the river. Suddenly, I heard Bang!","Bang! Bang! from three or","four guns. The Shepherdson men","had come quietly from behind","without their horses. The boys","ran for the river;","both of them were injured.","\"Kill them! Kill them!\"","the men shouted. I became","so sick that I almost","fell out of the tree.","I won't tell all that","happened next. It makes me","so sick just to think","about it. I wish that","I had never met the Grangerfords.","I stayed in the tree","until nighttime. Sometimes I heard","guns far in the distance","and twice I saw groups","of men ride by on","their horses. I felt very","guilty and as though the","fault were mine. I knew","now that the piece of","paper in the Bible meant","that Miss Sophia was to","meet Harney at half­past­two in","the morning and run off","with him. If I had","told her father about that","message, all of this would","not have happened. When I","climbed down from the tree,","I walked quietly along the","shore of the river and","found two bodies lying in","the water. I dragged them","out of the water and","covered their faces. I cried","as I covered Buck's face","because he had been a","very good friend to me.","It was dark now.","I never returned to the","Grangerford house. I went directly","to the place where Jim","was hiding. We got on","the raft and started down","the river. I didn't feel","comfortable until we were two","miles below there and out","in the middle of the Mississippi.","I was very glad to","get away from the feud,","and Jim was glad to","get out of hiding.","We said that there was","no home as wonderful as","a raft. Other places seem","so tight and breathing is difficult.","You feel very free and","easy and comfortable on a raft.","Two or three days and","nights passed; actually they moved","along quiet and smooth and lovely.","The river was very wide;","sometimes a mile and a","half wide. We traveled at","night and hid during the day.","When we saw the first","signs of early morning, we","would tie the raft to","shore and cover it with branches.","Then we would fish and","have a swim in the","river to cool ourselves.","We would sit in the","part of the river where","the water was not deep","and watch the sun rise.","Not a sound any­ where—perfectly","still—just like the whole world","was asleep, though sometimes we","heard the call of a","single bird. The first thing","that we saw in the","pale light of morning, looking","far across the water, was","a kind of dull line.","It was the trees on","the other side. We could","see nothing else. Then a","pale space appeared in the sky;","then more paleness spreading out","from the first. Then the","river seemed to soften, turning","from black to gray.","We could see little dark","spots moving on the water","very far away—boats—and long black","streaks— rafts. Then a gentle","wind would blow, cooling us.","The air smelled sweet because","of the flowers and trees.","The day was bright now.","A little smoke would not","be noticed, so we built","a fire and cooked some","fish and other food for breakfast.","After­ wards, we sat and","watched the loneliness of the","river until we were asleep.","As soon as it was","dark, we would push the","raft out into the river again.","Sometimes we would be the","only people on the river","for hours and hours.","It was lovely to live","on a raft. The sky","above us was filled with stars.","We lay on our backs","and looked at the stars","and discussed whether they were","made or just happened.","Jim said that they were","made, but I said that","they just happened. It would","have taken a long time","to make so many stars.","Jim said that the moon","could have laid them.","That seemed reasonable to me","when I thought about all","the eggs that birds have laid.","We watched falling stars, too,","and Jim said that they","were stars that were spoiled","and were thrown out of","the nest. Once or twice","during the night, a large","boat would pass us in","the dark. After a while,","the waves made by the","large boat would reach our","raft and shake it a little;","then all would be quiet again.","After midnight the people who","lived in the houses on","the shore went to bed.","Then for two or three","hours the shore was black—no","lights in the house windows.","The lights in the windows","acted as our clock— the","first light that appeared again","meant that morning was coming,","so we needed to find","a place to hide the","raft immediately. One morning after","sunrise, I found a canoe","and went a mile up","a stream that flowed into","the river. I was searching","for fruit for Jim and me.","Suddenly, two men came running","and shouting to me to","save their lives. They said","that men with dogs were","running after them. They jumped","into the canoe with me,","and soon I was rowing","as quickly as I could","toward our raft hidden on","the river. One of the","men had gray hair and","appeared to be nearly 70","years old. He wore an","old town hat, a dirty","blue wool shirt, and torn","blue trousers stuffed into his boots.","The other man was much","younger—about 30. He was dressed","in dirty old clothes, too.","After Jim and I fed","the two men their breakfasts,","we realized that they didn't","know each other. \"What were","you doing that caused you","to be in trouble?\"","the older man asked.","\"I was selling a substance","for cleaning teeth—and it did","clean them, but it ruined","them too. I stayed in","that town one night longer","than I should. I was","leaving when I met you.","You said that men with","dogs were running after you.","Since I was expecting trouble","also, I de­ cided to","run with you. And what","caused your trouble?\" \"I was","giving talks on the evils","of drinking whiskey and was","earn­ ing as much as","five or six dollars each night.","Women, especially, enjoyed what I","had to say. Then, somehow,","it was discovered that I","often drink whiskey myself.","I learned this morning that","people were quietly gath­ ering","with their dogs and planning","to run me out of town.\"","\"Old man,\" said the young","one, \"would you care to","become part of a team","with me?\" \"I might.","What do you do?\"","\"I've worked at a variety","of jobs—printing, teaching music, giv­","ing speeches—but what I enjoy","most is acting in the theater.","I like to think of","myself as an actor.","What kind of work do","you do?\" \"I give a","lot of speeches in churches—I","talk about religion and the","evils of drinking whiskey.","I also attempt to cure diseases.","I'm not a real doctor,","but I heal the sick","by laying my hands on them.\"","No one said anything for","a while. Then the younger","man sighed a long, sad sigh.","\"Why are you sighing?\"","\"To think that I should","now be in such shameful company.\"","And he wiped a tear","from his eye with a","dirty piece of cloth.","\"What's wrong with us?","Why would you want better","company than we are?\"","asked the older man.","\"I don't blame you gentlemen.","I brought myself down to","this low state.\" \"Brought yourself","down from where? Where were","you brought down from?\"","\"You won't believe me.","No one wants to believe me.","I'll reveal to you my","true name because I have","confidence in you. I'm the","Duke of Bridgewater. My great­grandfather,","the oldest son of the","Duke of Bridgewater, came to","America to breathe the pure","air of freedom. He married,","had a son, and died—at","the same time that his","father died back in England.","I'm directly related to that","baby boy. I'm the real","Duke of Bridgewater, though someone","else now holds that title.","Here I am, hated by","the world, hunted by men","with dogs, shamed into living","on a raft with such","low company.\" And he began","to cry. Jim and I","pitied him. We tried to","comfort him, but he said","that the only thing that","would make him feel better","was if we would recog­","nize him as a duke.","We said that we would","be happy to do this,","if he would tell us","how to act. \"You must","bow when you speak to","me and call me ‘Your","Grace' or ‘My Lord' or","simply ‘Bridgewater.' One of you","must serve me my meals","and do any jobs that","I need done.\" Throughout dinner,","Jim stood and served Bridgewater","his food. \"Will Your Grace","like some fish? Will My","Lord like some corn bread?\"","Bridgewater seemed very pleased with","this attention. I noticed that","the old man was not pleased.","He was very quiet and","didn't seem happy with all","the attention being shown to Bridgewater.","That afternoon he said, \"I'm","sorry about your troubles, Bridgewater,","but you're not the only","person with troubles of that kind.","No, you aren't the only","person who has fallen from","a high position.\" \"What do","you mean?\" \"You're not the","only person who has a","secret—who is of noble birth.","Can I trust you?\"","\"To the bitter death!\"","He took the old man's","hand in his and said,","\"That secret of yours—speak!\"","\"Bridgewater, I'm the Dauphin.\"","Jim and I stared.","The duke said, \"You're who?\"","\"Yes, my friend, it's true.","Your eyes are looking this","very moment at the long","lost Dauphin, Louis the Seventeenth,","son of Louis the Sixteenth","and Marie Antoinette.\" \"But you're","too old to be the Dauphin.\"","\"Trouble has aged me.","Trouble has caused my gray hairs.","This unhappy person that you","see before you in these","dirty old clothes is the","rightful King of France.\"","He cried and looked so","unhappy that Jim and I","decided that the only way","we could make him feel","good was to tell him","how happy and proud we","were that he was with us.","We told him that we","would gladly treat him in","the same manner that we","were treating the duke.","He thanked us and said","that there was not much","we could do to help","him feel happy. However, he","said that it often made","him feel better if peo­","ple treated him like a","king, if they got down","on one knee whenever they","spoke to him and always","called him \"Your Majesty,\" and","if they served him first","at meals, and always remained","standing until he told them","that they could sit.","Jim and I thought that","we could manage that, and","always said \"Your Majesty\" when","we spoke to him, and","always remained standing until he","told us to sit down.","This made him feel much","happier, but we soon noticed","that the duke was looking","unhappy and not the least","bit pleased with the way","we were treating the old man.","When the old man noticed","the change in the duke,","he said, \"We'll be together","on this raft for a","long time, and we can't","be unpleasant and unfriendly to","each other. That would only","make us all feel uncomfort­ able.","It's not my fault that","I wasn't born a duke","and it's not your fault","that you weren't born a king.","We'll have to make the","best of this situ­ ation.","Give me your hand and","let's be friends.\" The duke","shook the old man's hand.","Jim and I were happy","to see that they were","friends again. We couldn't permit","any unfriendliness or uncom­ fortableness","on the raft. What's needed","on a raft, more than","anything else, is for everyone","to be satisfied and to","feel kindly toward the others.","I knew from the beginning","that these men were not","kings or dukes, but just liars.","I never said anything, never","let them know, but kept","this information to myself.","I didn't want to have","quarrels on the raft, didn't","want to have trouble.","If they wanted Jim and","me to call them king","and duke, I wouldn't object.","What I wanted was to","keep peace in the family.","I learned one thing from","Pap and that was the","best way to get along","with this kind of people","is to let them have","their own way. The two","men asked Jim and me","many questions. They wanted to","know why we hid the","raft and why we never","traveled in the daytime.","Traveling at night was far","more difficult and dangerous than","traveling during the day, and","they suspected that we were","hiding for some rea­ son.","Finally, they asked if Jim","was a runaway slave.","\"Would a runaway slave run south?","Would a runaway slave trav­","el toward New Orleans?","You know that New Orleans","is as close to hell","as a slave can get,\"","I answered. \"Of course he wouldn't.","But why are you two","always hiding?\" \"My family lived","in Missouri, where I was born.","Everyone died except for my","Pap and my brother Ike","and me. We were traveling","down to New Orleans to","live with my Uncle Ben","when a large boat hit","our raft. My Pap and","my brother drowned; only our","slave Jim and I escaped.","The following day, several people","came out to our raft","to try to take Jim,","saying they believed that he","was a runaway slave.","For this reason, we don't","travel in the daytime anymore.","At night, no one notices us.\"","The duke said, \"Let me","think of a way that","we can travel in the","daytime if we want to.","I'll think of a plan—but","not today. Until we get","far away from this town,","we should travel only at night.\"","When it was dark, very","dark, we started down the river.","At about ten o'clock, it","began to rain and blow","and thunder and lightning.","The king told us both","to stay awake and watch","for danger, while he and","the duke went inside the","tent to sleep. I didn't","mind staying out in the storm.","How the wind screamed!","And every few seconds, the","lightning would light up the","waves in the river.","Then would follow the whack!— bum!","bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum of the thunder.","The waves nearly washed me","off the raft sometimes, but","I wasn't wearing clothes and","didn't mind. When I became","sleepy, I tried to enter","the tent, but there was","no room for me inside.","I slept outside in the","rain while Jim stayed awake","to watch. When he saw","the first lights in cab­","ins on shore, he awakened","me and we began to","look for a place to","tie the raft. After breakfast,","the king and the duke","sat talking about how they","could earn some money.","The duke told of plays","that he had acted in","and showed us some of","the clothing that he had","worn in these plays.","The king said that he","would be happy to take","part in anything that would","pay but that he had","never acted in a play before.","The duke said that he","had finally thought of a","plan that would allow us","to travel during the daytime","without it being dangerous for Jim.","He said that he wanted","to visit the next town","we passed, and the king","said that he would go","with him. They hoped to","find a way to earn","some money. We needed some","supplies, so Jim told me","to go with them.","When we reached the town,","the streets were empty.","No one was to be","seen anywhere. A black slave","told us that everyone had","gone to a church camp","meeting held in a nearby forest.","The king asked me to","go with him to this","church meeting. The duke said","that he didn't want to","attend, but would look for","a printing shop. Nearly 1,000","people were at the camp meeting.","Church services were being held","in cheaply built wooden buildings.","The people sat on logs","instead of chairs and sang","many church songs. The more","they sang, the louder they","got and some began to shout.","Some seemed almost crazy, and","rolled on the floor in","a wild manner. Suddenly, the","king started to shout.","He ran to the front","of the room and told","them all that he had","been a pirate in the","Indian Ocean for 30 years.","He said that many of","his pirates were killed in","a fight last spring and","that he was looking for","men who would be willing","to work as pirates.","He said that all his","money had been stolen from","him and he was glad","that it had happened.","He was now a changed","man and was happy for","the first time in his life.","Though he was poor, he","planned to begin to work","to pay for a return","trip to the Indian Ocean","and would spend the rest","of his life trying to","get pirates to stop their","killing and stealing and live","good, respectable lives. He said","that he could do this","better than anyone else because","he knew all the pirates","in the Indian Ocean.","And each time that he","helped a pirate he planned","to say, \"Don't thank me.","Thank the good people who","live in Pokeville, whom I","met at a church camp meeting.\"","Then he began to cry","and so did everyone else.","Then someone shouted, \"Collect money","for him.\" Then several men","jumped up and said, \"Let","him come around and collect money.\"","Which is what he did.","When we returned to the","raft, he counted his money","and had 87 dollars.","The duke had already returned","to the raft, and told","how he had done some","printing jobs for farmers and","took the money. The owner","of the printing company was","at the church camp meeting,","so the duke acted as","though he were the shop","owner and took money for","printing jobs. He had earned","more than nine dollars in","this way. Then he showed","us a job he had","printed for us. It had","a picture of a runaway,","black slave and the words","\"200 DOLLAR REWARD\" under the","pic­ ture. The writing beneath","this was about Jim and","described him exact­ ly.","It said that whoever caught","Jim and returned him to","his owner in New Orleans","would get the reward money.","\"After tonight,\" said the duke,","\"we can travel in the daytime.","Whenever we see anyone approaching,","we can tie Jim's hands","and feet with a rope","and say that we had","caught Jim up the river","and are return­ ing him","to his owner in New","Orleans and that we will","be paid the reward money.\"","We all thought that the","duke had arrived at the","perfect solution to our problem.","We knew that there would","be trouble in Pokeville when","the print shop owner returned","and realized what had happened,","so we stayed hidden until","late at night. Then we","traveled our last night on","the river. After this, we","would be free to travel","during daylight hours and could","do so at a much","faster speed. Daylight came, but","we continued to travel.","It was the first time","that Jim and I had","traveled during the daytime.","After breakfast, the king sat","on a corner of the","raft, took off his shoes,","rolled up his trousers, and","let his legs hang in","the water. When he was","nicely comfortable, he began to","read Shakespeare's play, \"Romeo and Juliet.\"","He was learning certain speeches","and when he could say","them without looking at the","book, the duke began to","practice with him. The duke","told the king exactly how","his voice should sound when","saying the speeches, how he","should stand, and the motions","he should make with his hands.","Next, they practiced fighting with","long swords which the duke","had made from pieces of wood.","The duke called himself King","Richard III and taught the","king the noble art of","sword fighting. They practiced until","the king tripped and fell","into the river. After dinner,","the duke said, \"We'll want","this to be a good","show, so we'll need to","add one more scene.","Why don't we do a","scene from ‘Hamlet?' \" Then","he stood in a most","noble manner, with one leg","slight­ ly forward, his arms","stretched high, and his head","back and looking up at","the sky. He began to","speak in a loud voice,","making long, loud, sad cries,","his arms waving wildly and","his chest swelling out.","It was the best acting","that I had ever seen.","The king said that he","liked the speech and soon","was able to act it","as well as the duke.","As soon as we came","to a small town, we","stopped and the duke located","a printer and had announcements printed.","The following few days, as","we traveled down the river,","the raft became a very","lively place. The king and","duke were sword fighting or","practicing their speeches all the time.","One morning we came in","sight of a small town","in the state of Arkansas.","We hid the raft in","a small stream and left","Jim with our sup­ plies.","The king, the duke, and","I rowed the canoe into","town to learn if there","was a possibility that we","could perform our show here.","We were lucky. A traveling","show had arrived that morning","and people from the surrounding","country were already coming in","to see it. That show","was to be performed in","the afternoon, and the people","might stay to see our","show if we gave it later.","We nailed our printed signs","onto trees throughout the town.","They read like this:","Scenes from Shakespeare Wonderful Show","One Night Only World Famous","Actors David Garrick, the Younger,","of Drury Lane Theatre, London,","England Edmund Kean, the Elder,","of Royal Hay Market Theatre,","London, England in scenes from","\"Romeo and Juliet\" \"Richard III\"","\"Hamlet\" Has been performed 300","times in Paris! Charge:","Adults — 25 cents Children","— 10 cents When we","had no more signs to","put on the trees, we","walked around the town.","All the stores and houses","were old and hadn't been","painted in years. No flowers","or grass grew in the","yards, which were filled with","broken bottles, old shoes, and","dirty pots and pans.","Pigs, instead of being kept","in pens, wandered through the yards.","A few stores were along","one street. Men sat on","empty boxes in front of","these stores, smoking tobacco, talking","about nothing important, half asleep.","They seemed to care about","little, and had nothing else","to do all day long.","No one worked. The streets","were simply mud—black mud, as","much as a foot deep","in some places. A mother","pig with a dozen baby","pigs could be seen lying","in the mud in the","middle of the main street.","People were beginning to come","into the town to see","the show. They rode in","wagons pulled by horses.","Many were eating their lunches","on the backs of their wagons.","Many of the men were","drinking whiskey and fighting with","each other. Soon someone shouted,","\"Here comes old Boggs—in from","the country to get drunk.","Here he comes, boys!\"","All the men sitting on","the boxes in front of","the stores suddenly looked happy.","One of them said, \"I","wonder whom he'll threaten this time.","If he killed all the","men that he has threatened","to kill, there would be","few men left alive in","this town.\" Boggs came riding","on his horse, shouting and","calling in a loud voice,","\"Get out of my way!","I plan to shoot someone!\"","He was very drunk and","nearly fell off his horse.","Everyone called loudly to him,","and he shouted back to","them and said he would","shoot them later. But first","he had come to town","to kill old Colonel Sherburn.","When he saw me, he","said, \"Where did you come","from, boy? Are you prepared","to die?\" I was frightened,","but a man standing near","me said, \"He doesn't mean","what he says. He talks","that way only because he's drunk.","He's one of the nicest","men in the state of Arkansas.","He never hurt anyone.\"","Boggs rode to the largest","store in the town, and","shouted, \"Come out here, Sherburn!","Come out and meet the","man whose money you stole.","You're the man I want","to see so that I","can shoot you.\" He called","Sherburn every disrespectful name that","he could think of.","The crowd on the street","listened and laughed until a","well dressed man, about 55","years old, walked out of","the store. The crowd stepped","back to give him space.","The man spoke to Boggs","in a calm, slow voice,","\"I'm tired of your talk","but will listen to it","until one o'clock—until one o'clock","and no longer. If you","say one more word against","me after that time, I'll","kill you.\" Then he turned","and went inside the store.","The crowd was now quiet","and serious. Nobody moved, and","there was no more laughing.","Boggs continued riding up and","down the street shouting to Sherburn.","Some men crowded around him","and attempted to get him","to be quiet, but he refused.","He continued to call Sherburn","every disrespectful name that he","could think of. Several men","told him that it would","soon be one o'clock and","they tried to force him","to go home. A man","shouted, \"Someone run to get","his daughter—quick! Get his daughter, please.","Sometimes he'll listen to her.","Perhaps she can make him","stop the shouting.\" And I","watched two men run off","down the street. All was","quiet for awhile. In five","or ten minutes I saw","Boggs again, but not on","his horse. He was walking","down the street toward me,","with a friend on each","side of him holding his","arms and hurrying him along.","He was quiet and unhappy.","Suddenly, a man called out, \"Boggs!\"","I looked to see who","had shouted, and I saw","Colonel Sherburn standing perfectly still","in the street, with a","small gun in his right","hand—not aiming it, but holding","it pointed up toward the sky.","At that same instant, I","saw a young girl and","two men running toward Boggs.","When Boggs heard his name","called, he turned to see","who had spoken to him.","When the two men holding","Boggs saw the gun, they","jumped away from him.","Sherburn slowly lowered the gun","and aimed at Boggs.","\"Don't shoot!\" Boggs cried, just","as the first shot was fired.","Boggs fell back as a","second shot was heard.","Boggs now lay on the","ground with his arms spread out.","The young girl screamed and","came running. She threw herself","on top of her father","and kept crying, \"He killed him!","He killed him!\" The crowd","made a tight circle around","the two, with people in","the back stretching their necks","to see what was happening.","Colonel Sherburn threw his gun","onto the ground and turned","and walked away. Several men","carried Boggs to a nearby store.","I followed and could watch","what was happening through the","store window. They lay Boggs","on the floor and put","a large Bible under his head.","He breathed a few times","and then lay quietly.","He was dead. The men","pulled his daughter away from","him screaming and crying, and","led her away. Soon all","the people of the town","were pushing toward the window","to look through at Boggs.","I decided to leave, fearing","that there might be trouble.","Every­ one who had seen","the shooting was telling how","it happened. One tall, thin","man wearing a tall, white","fur hat marked the places","on the ground where Boggs","had stood and where Sherburn","had stood. The people watched","closely, shaking their heads to","let him know that they understood.","Finally, the man stood straight","and stiff where Sherburn had","stood, and called out, \"Boggs!\"","and lifted his walking stick","as though to aim it","and shouted, \"Bang!\" Then he","called out \"Bang!\" a second","time and fell backwards onto","the ground. The people watching","him said that he did","it perfectly; they said it","was exactly the way that","it all happened. Then at","least a dozen people took","out their bottles of whiskey","and gave him drinks.","Soon, someone shouted that Sherburn","ought to be hanged.","Then everyone was saying it.","The crowd soon went mad,","yelling and getting every piece","of rope they could find","to do the hanging with.","The crowd of men moved","slowly and steadily toward Sherburn's","house, shouting and screaming, \"Hang him!","Hang him!\" Children were pushed","out of the way.","Women's faces appeared at every","window, eager to see what","the crowd would do.","Many women and girls were","cry­ ing, frightened by the","thought of what would happen next.","The men stood shoulder to","shoulder in front of the","fence sur­ rounding Sherburn's front yard.","\"Tear down the fence!","Tear down the fence!\"","they shouted. Then came the","sound of broken wood as","the fence was torn apart,","and the crowd moved into","the front yard. At that","moment, Sherburn stepped out onto","the roof of his front","porch with a large gun","in his hand. He stood","perfectly calm and still.","He spoke not a word.","The crowd was suddenly silent,","and those in the front","slowly began to move back.","Sherburn never said a word—just","stood there looking down.","The stillness made every man","in the crowd look uncomfortable.","Sherburn moved his eyes slowly","along the faces in the","crowd, and whenever he stopped","to look a man directly","in the eye that man","quickly looked down at the ground.","No man could look directly","into Sherburn's face. Then Sherburn laughed;","not a pleasant laugh but","the kind of laugh that","makes you feel like you've","been eating bread with sand","in it. Finally, Sherburn spoke.","\"The idea of you hanging anyone!","This makes me laugh.","The idea of any of","you thinking that you had","the courage to hang a man!","A man is perfectly safe","in the hands of ten","thousand of your kind—at least","in the daytime. \"Do I","know you? I know you","very well. I was born","and raised in the South","and I've lived in the","North, so I know both","kinds of people. The average","man has no courage.","Your newspapers call you a","brave people so often that","you think that you are brave.","Why don't your courts of","law hang men for murder?","Because they're afraid that the","man's friends will shoot them","in the back, in the","dark—and this is just what","they would do. \"The courts","always allow murderers to go free.","Then a man goes in","the night, with one hundred","cowards at his back, and","hangs the murderer. Your mistake","is that you didn't bring","a man with you;","that's one mistake. Your second","mistake is that you didn't","come in the dark.","You brought part of a","man—Buck Harkness, there—without him, you","wouldn't have come at all.","\"You didn't want to come.","The average man doesn't like","trouble and danger. You don't","like trouble and danger.","But if only half a","man— like Buck Harkness, there—shouts,","‘Hang him! Hang him!'","you're afraid not to follow","him, afraid you'll be seen","as the cowards you are.","So you follow behind this","half a man, shouting about","the big things that you're","going to do. The pitiful","thing about men in an","angry crowd is that they","don't fight with the courage","that's born in them, but","with courage that's borrowed from","a leader. But a crowd","without a real man as","a leader is beneath pitifulness.","Now the thing for you","to do is to go","home and hide in a hole.","If any hanging is to","be done, it will be","done in the dark.","Now leave—and take your half­a­man","with you.\" With these words","he lifted his gun and","aimed it at the crowd.","The crowd moved away from","him suddenly. Men began to","run in all directions.","Buck Harkness turned and ran","after the others. I could","have stayed if I wanted","but I didn't want to.","That night we gave our","show, but only about twelve","people came to see it.","The people didn't understand the","show and laughed all the time.","That made the duke very angry.","Everyone left before the show","had ended, except for one","boy who was asleep.","The duke said that the","people were not smart enough","for Shakespeare. He said that","he knew the type of","show that would please them.","The next morning he got","some large sheets of paper","and some black paint and","made new signs. This is","what he wrote on the signs:","AT THE COURT HOUSE for","3 nights only World­Famous Actors","David Garrick, the Younger, and","Edmund Kean, the Elder In","the Exciting Play \"The King's","Cameleopard\" Charge 50 cents WOMEN","AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED \"There,\"","said the duke, \"if that","last line doesn't bring them","to the show, I don't","know Arkansas!\" All day, the","Duke and the King worked","to build a stage with","a curtain and a row","of candles for footlights.","That night the house was","filled with men coming to","see the show. The duke","came onto the stage in","front of the curtain and","made a little speech.","He praised the show and","said that it was the","most exciting one that ever was.","He told how Edmund Kean","was the best actor in","the world. When the duke","had got the men very","excited and eager to see","the show, he opened the","curtain and the king came out.","He was com­ pletely naked","and his body was painted","every bright color imaginable.","He looked wild, but it","was very funny. The people","almost died laugh­ ing.","The king did a kind","of little dance, and the","men laughed louder. They stood","up and cheered louder, and","the king returned and did","the dance one more time.","Then he left the stage.","The duke closed the curtain","and bowed to the men","and said that the show","would be performed two more times.","He said that he was","sorry that they could not","perform it more often, but","that they must soon return","to London. He said if","they had succeeded in pleasing","them, to please ask other","men in the town to","come to see the show.","Twenty people shouted, \"What?","Has the show ended?","Is that all?\" Suddenly, the","angry crowd stood up and","began to move toward the stage.","Then a tall, good­looking gentleman","jumped up and stood on","a chair, shouting, \"Stop!","Listen to me. We were tricked!","We've been made to look","like fools. But do we","want the entire town laughing","at us. No! What we","have to do is to","leave here quietly, tell the","others that it was a","great show, and try to","get all the men of","the town to come to","see it. Then we'll all","be fools together.\" Everyone agreed","that he was correct and","left quietly. The follow­ ing","day, the men were busy","telling other men about the","great show. There was a","large crowd the second night,","and again the king appeared","naked with his body brightly","painted and again the show","lasted only a few minutes.","And again the men were","angry, but left quietly.","On the third night, the","crowd was very large, the","largest that it had been.","But I noticed that the","men who had already seen","the first or second shows","were returning to see the","third one. That seemed strange","to me. Then the duke","and I noticed that every","man had a large object","under his coat or in","his pocket, and I knew","from the smell that these","objects were old and spoiled","fruits, vegetables, and eggs.","When the room was so","full that no more men","could fit into it, the","duke said that it was","time for him to go","on stage and introduce the king.","I followed him. When we","came near the stage door,","he said, \"Walk quickly down","the street. As soon as","we are away from this","theater, run to the raft.\"","I did as he said,","and we both ran to","the raft as fast as","we could. Soon we were","moving away from the shore","and out toward the middle","of the river. Neither of","us said a word.","I felt sad for the","poor king who had been","left behind with the angry crowd.","You can imagine my sur­","prise when I heard a","voice call out from the","tent on the raft, \"What","happened at the show?\"","The king had not left","the raft to go to","the show that night.","We did not dare build","a fire or show a","light until we were ten","miles down the river.","Then as Jim and I","cooked supper, the king and","the duke laughed and laughed","at the way that they","had tricked the men of","that town. They counted the","money they had earned—465 dollars—and","felt that was good pay","for three nights of work.","Later, when they were asleep,","Jim said, \"Are you surprised","at the way the king","and duke act, Huck?\"","\"No, Jim, I'm not.","Our duke and king are","not honest, but then I","don't think any member of","royalty has ever been honest.\"","\"That's how I feel too, Jim.","But we have them with","us, and we'll have to","continue treating them like royalty.\"","I didn't tell Jim what","I had suspected for a","long time—that the two men","traveling with us were not","real kings and dukes.","But real kings and dukes","would have acted, in the","same way that our two","acted, so what difference did","it make? It was time","for me to go to","sleep, and Jim said that","he would sit up and watch.","Just before daylight, I heard","him crying softly to himself.","He was thinking about his","wife and children and was","missing them. It was the","first time that he had","ever been away from his","home and he longed to","be back with his family.","I do believe that he","cared as much for his","family as white men cared","for theirs. I asked him","about his family, and he","said, \"What made me think","of my family now was","a sound that I heard","on the shore—the sound of","a door closing with a bang.","The sound reminded me of","a time that I was","mean to my Elizabeth.","She was only four years","old and she had been","very sick. When she was","no longer sick, I saw","her playing one day and","said to her, ‘Close the door.'","She didn't do it.","She just continued to smile","at me and didn't obey.","Again I said, ‘Close the","door,' and again she didn't obey.","This made me so angry","that I hit her with","my hand and she fell","to the floor. She lay","there crying but still she","wouldn't close the door.","I was going to hit","her again, when suddenly the","wind blew the door closed","with a very loud bang!","Elizabeth never noticed; she never moved.","I called to her as","loud as I could call,","and she never looked at me.","Then I knew that she","couldn't hear—her illness had caused","a problem with her ears","and she wasn't able to hear.","I began to cry and","picked her up in my","arms and said, ‘Forgive me,'","but she couldn't hear me.","I asked God to forgive","me, but I never have","been able to forgive myself.","And my little girl has","never spoken a word since.","She can't hear and she","can't speak.\" We traveled all","the next day and stopped","for the night in a","section of the river where","there was a town on","either shore. The duke and","the king again began to","plan how they would trick","the people in those towns.","Jim said that he hoped","that they would not stay","away from the raft a","long time because he was","tired of having to be","tied up with ropes and","kept in the tent on","the raft all day.","He was frightened every time","that he heard anyone come","near the raft. We kept","Jim tied so that it","would appear that we had","caught him as a runaway","slave and were holding him","prisoner until we could return","him to his owner.","The duke and the king","were afraid to repeat the","show that they had performed","the last three nights, for","they feared that men in","this town may have heard","about the trick that they","had played. The duke said","that he would stay on","the raft and think about","a new plan, while the","king and I went to","one of the towns to","see what the people were like.","The king had bought himself","a new suit of black","clothes, which he was wearing.","I never knew that clothes","could change a person so completely.","In his old clothes, he","looked like the meanest man","who ever lived, while his","new clothes made him look","like a grand and good","and holy person. The king","and I stepped into the canoe.","We had seen a large","pas­ senger boat about three","miles up the river, and","the king decided to row","to the boat and buy","a ticket and ride back","down to the town where","we had left the raft.","The king thought that he","could make the people in","the town believe that we","come from a large city","like St. Louis or Cincinnati.","I was very excited at","the thought of getting a","ride on a large pas­","senger boat and began to","row quickly up the river","toward the boat. We had","not gone very far when","we noticed a boy walking","along the river's edge, carrying","some heavy bags. \"Where are","you going?\" asked the king.","\"I'm going to ride on","the passenger boat to New Orleans.\"","\"Get into our canoe and","we'll row you to the boat.","My servant will help you","with your bags. Help this","gentleman, Adolphus.\" I knew that","he meant me, so I","jumped out of the canoe","and helped the boy.","Then the three of us","continued rowing up the river.","\"When I first saw you,","I thought that you must","be Mr. Wilks and that","you had arrived just a","bit too late, but then","I thought again and realized","that you would not be","rowing up the river if","you were Mr. Wilks, so","you must be someone else.\"","The king answered, \"No, I'm","not Mr. Wilks. My name","is Blodgett —Alexander Blodgett.","I'm sorry that this Mr.","Wilks did not arrive in","time, and I hope that","he didn't miss anything important.\"","\"He didn't miss getting property.","He'll still get that.","But he missed seeing his","brother Peter alive. Peter would","have given anything to have","seen his brother before he died.","He talked of little else","the last three weeks of","his life. The two brothers","had not seen each other","since they were children.","And there was a third","brother, William, whom Peter had","never seen at all.","William was much younger—he would","be only thirty or thirty­five","years old—and he couldn't hear","or speak. Only the two","brothers—Harvey and William—are left of","the family, and they live","in England.\" \"Did anyone write","to them to tell them","that Peter was ill?\"","\"Oh yes. Peter himself wrote","a few months ago—when he","first became ill. He was","quite old and had the","feeling that he would never","be well again. He had","one brother, George, who had","lived here in America with","him, but George and his","wife died last year.","They had three daughters, who","continued to live with Peter","and he wanted to be","sure that they got all","his property after his death.","That was all that the","girls would have to live on.\"","\"I'm sorry Peter didn't live","to see his brothers.","What are his nieces' names","and how old are they?\"","\"Mary Jane is nineteen, Susan","is fifteen, and Joanne is fourteen.","Joanne is very sweet and","is always doing good works,","but she's not all that pretty.\"","The king looked very sad.","\"I'm sorry that the girls","are left all alone in","the cold, cold world.\"","\"They're not alone. Peter Wilks","had many friends, and these","friends will see that the","girls get the property Peter","has left for them.","There's Hobson, Lot Hovey, Ben","Rucker, Abner Shackleford, Levi Bell,","the lawyer, and Dr.","Robinson. The wives of all","these men are also his","friends and so is the","Widow Bartley. Those are the","people that Peter wrote to","his brother Harvey about.","When Harvey arrives, he'll know","who to turn to for help.\"","The king continued asking the","boy questions until he knew","about everything and everyone in","that town—all about the Wilkses,","about Peter's business (he was","a tanner), and about his","brothers' businesses. Finally, he asked,","\"Was Peter Wilks wealthy?\"","\"Oh, yes, quite wealthy.","He had houses and land","and left nearly 4,000 dollars","hidden somewhere.\" \"When did he die?\"","\"Last night. His funeral will","be tomorrow at about noon.\"","When we reached the boat,","the king never said a","word about our going on","it for a ride.","I was disappointed because I","had wanted very much to","travel on a passenger boat.","The boy left us and","went on the passenger boat alone.","As soon as the boy","was gone, the king told","me to go another mile","further up the river;","then he got out of","the canoe and went on shore.","He told me that he","would wait there, but that","I was to take the","canoe and go quickly to","get the duke and return","with him. He said that","I should row as fast","as I possibly could.","I knew what his plan","was but never said a word.","I returned with the duke","as quickly as I could,","then hid the canoe.","The king told the duke","the complete story of Peter","Wilks and was already trying","to speak like an Englishman.","He then asked the duke","if he could act as","though he were a man","who couldn't hear or speak,","and the duke said that","he thought that he could","manage that very well.","Late in the afternoon, another","large passenger boat came down","the river, and we waved","our arms until the boat stopped.","We then trav­ eled the","four or five miles to","the town where Peter Wilks","had lived. Many men from","the town were waiting to","greet passengers getting off the boat.","The king asked if anyone","could direct him to the","house of Mr. Peter Wilks.","One man spoke softly and gently.","\"I'm sorry, sir, the best","that I can do is","to tell you where he","had lived until yesterday.\"","The king fell against the","man, put his head on","the man's shoul­ der, and","cried like a baby.","\"Oh, my poor brother—gone—dead.","And we never got to","see him. This is too","hard to bear.\" Then he","turned to the duke and","began making signs with his","hands as though he were","telling him something. The next","instant the duke burst into","tears, also. Well, I could","see they were starting a","new plan to fool these","people like they had done","to the others. The men","of the town felt so","sorry for these two that","they held them as they","cried, then told the king","about his brother's last hours","of life. The king made","signs with his hands as","though he were then telling","all that he heard to","his brother. Then they both","began to cry even harder","than before. The sight of","these two made me feel sick.","It was enough to make","a person feel shame for","the human race. The news","that we had arrived soon","spread through the town.","People came running from every","direction to greet us, some","still putt­ing on their coats","as they ran. Soon we","were in the middle of","a large crowd. I could","hear people asking, \"Is it them?\"","When we reached the Wilks's","house the street in front","of it was filled with","people, and three girls were","standing at the door.","Mary Jane, the oldest, was","beautiful and her face seemed","to glow, she was that","happy that her uncles had come.","The king held her in","his arms, while the duke","held the youngest girl.","All the women watching cried","for joy to see them","meet again at last.","When the king saw Peter","Wilks's body laid out at","one end of the room,","he put his arm round","the duke's shoulder and slowly","walked toward the body.","They both started crying again,","louder than ever, and were","soon joined by the three girls.","Tears were in the eyes","of every per­ son in","the room, but the two","who cried the loudest and","the longest were the king","and the duke. I never","felt so angry and so","ashamed in my life.","When the king could control","his crying, he told the","people in the room the","long journey we had made","from England—a journey of 4,000 miles.","He said that he and","his nieces would be happy","if a few of Peter's","closest friends stayed to eat","supper with them that evening,","and he named those people","his brother had often mentioned","in his letters: Mr.","Hobson, Lot Hovey, Ben Rucker,","Abner Shackleford, Levi Bell, Dr.","Robinson, and their wives, and","the Widow Bartley. Mr.","Hobson and Dr. Robinson were","out of town together and","Levi Bell was in Louisville","on business, but the rest","were there and thanked the","king for the invitation.","The king continued talking about","nearly everyone in that town","and mentioned many things that","had happened. He said that","his brother Peter had written","all this in letters to him.","That was a lie, of course.","He had learned these facts","from the young boy that","we had taken to the","passenger boat that morning.","Mary Jane gave the king","the letter that Peter Wilks","had left. The king read","it aloud and cried.","Peter had left the house","and 3,000 dollars in gold","to the girls, and he","left the tannery and 3,000","dollars in gold to his","brothers, Harvey and William.","He told where he had","hidden the 6,000 dollars in","the basement of his house.","The king and the duke","asked me to go with","them to the basement and","when they found the bag","of gold they poured it","out onto the floor and","counted it. Four hundred and","fifteen dollars were missing!","They counted the money a","second time, and again they","found that instead of 6,000","dollars in gold, they had","only 5,585 dollars. They searched","the basement, but couldn't find","the missing dollars. The king","said the best plan would","be to add four hundred","and fifteen dollars of their","own money, otherwise they might","appear dishonest. The duke said","that he had another idea.","To keep the people from","suspecting they were dishonest, he","told the king that they","should carry the bag upstairs,","count the money in front","of the group, and give","the complete 6,000 dollars to","the girls. The king said","that was the clever­ est","idea that they had had yet.","When we got upstairs, everyone","crowded around the table as","the king poured out the","gold dollars. He put the","money into twenty piles— three","hundred dollars in each pile.","The people in the room","looked hungrily at the money.","The king then turned to","the people and began another","of his speeches. \"Friends, my","poor brother, who now lies","dead, was generous to those","he loved—his three nieces.","And we know that he","would have been even more","generous to them if he","had not been afraid of","hurting my brother William and me.","I'm certain that William feels","as I do. Let me","ask him.\" And the king","turned to William and made","a lot of signs with","his hands. William looked foolish","at first, and then his","face brightened as though he","suddenly understood and he started","jumping around from joy and","the king said, \"I knew","that he would feel the","way that I do about this.","Here, Mary Jane, Susan, and","Joanna, take the money—take it all.","The complete 6,000 dollars.\"","Mary Jane danced about and","began kissing the king, while","Susan and Joanna kissed the duke.","Then everybody started kissing the","duke and the king and","shaking their hands and saying","that it was the loveli­","est thing that they had","ever seen. Then the king","made another speech about his","dear dead brother, and invited","everyone in the room to","come to the funeral.","Suddenly, a man laughed right","in his face. Everyone turned","to see who had dared","to laugh at such a","sad time. \"Why, Dr.","Robinson,\" said Abner Shackleford, \"you've","been away and haven't met","this man. This is Harvey Wilks.\"","The king smiled and extended","his hand to shake the","hand of the doctor.","\"Keep your hands to yourself,\"","said the doctor. \"You're no","English­ man. Your voice sounds","nothing like an Englishman.","You say that you're Peter","Wilks's brother! Never! You've been lying.\"","The crowd around the doctor","tried to quiet him and","tried to explain to him","how Harvey had proved in","many ways that he was","Peter Wilks's brother—how he knew","everyone's name in town and","even knew the names of","the dogs. They begged the","doctor not to hurt the","girls' feelings, but the doctor","wouldn't listen to them.","Peter Wilks's three nieces began","to cry and begged the","doctor to stop. \"I was","your father's friend, and I'm","your friend,\" the doctor said","to them. \"I warn you","as a friend, and an","honest one who wants to","protect you and keep you","out of harm and trouble,","to turn your backs on","these two liars and have","nothing to do with them.","This man has given you","a lot of names and","facts which he learned somewhere,","and you're eager to believe","that this proves that he","is your uncle. Mary Jane","Wilks, you know me for","your friend, send these two","liars away. I beg you","to do this. Will you?\"","Mary Jane looked into the","doctor's eyes and said, \"Here's","your answer.\" She picked up","the bag of gold dollars","and put it into the","king's hands and said to","the king, \"Take this 6,000","dollars and put it into","a bank or a business","for my sisters and me.","I trust you.\" She then","put her arms around the","king and her sisters did","the same. The king held","up his head and smiled proudly.","When the people had left,","the King asked Mary Jane","if there was room for","us to sleep in her house.","She said that she had","a spare room for Uncle","William, a very small room","that I could use, and","that she would be happy","for Uncle Harvey to sleep","in her room. She would","move into the room that","her sisters shared. We went","upstairs with her and she","showed us the rooms.","She told the king that","she would remove her dresses","that were hanging along the","wall of the room which","he would use; but he","told her to leave them.","At supper that evening, I","had to wait on the","king and the duke and","serve them their food.","Afterward, Joanna and I ate","our own sup­ per in","the kitchen and had a","nice long talk. I liked","her very much and began","to feel very guilty and","mean when I remembered how","I was help­ ing the","duke and the king steal","her money. I decided that","I would take the money","away from the king and","give it to the three girls.","I went to bed early","so that I could have","time to think of a","plan for getting the money.","I wanted to take the","money in such a manner","that the king would never","suspect me. I planned to","steal the money and hide it.","Later when we were far","down the river, I would","write Mary Jane a letter","and tell her where the","money was hidden. But where","was the money? I knew","that I had to search","the king's and the duke's rooms.","I entered the king's room,","but it was too dark","to see much. I began","feeling around the room, when","suddenly I heard the sound","of feet in the hall.","I quickly hid behind the","dresses that were hang­ ing","on the wall. The king","and the duke came into","the room and closed the door.","The first thing that the","duke did was look under","the bed. I was glad","that I had not chosen","to hide there. \"What did","you want to tell me?\"","asked the king. \"Talk quickly.","We should be downstairs with","the others.\" \"I don't feel comfortable.","I keep worrying about that doctor.","I think that we should","take the 6,000 dollars and","leave tonight—when everyone is asleep.\"","This talk frightened me.","Would I be able to","steal the money before they left?","\"What! And not sell the","rest of the property?","We would be fools to","leave before we have gotten","all the money that we","can out of this.","The house and the tannery","must be worth 9,000 dollars.\"","The duke complained about this","plan and argued that the","bag of gold was enough.","He didn't want to take","everything that the three girls had.","\"Don't talk that way,\" said","the king. \"We won't be","taking anything more from them","than the 6,000 dollars.","The people who buy the","prop­ erty will be the","ones to suffer. As soon","as it's discovered that we","didn't really own the property,","the sale will be found","to be unlawful and the","girls will get their property returned.","We'll be far away with","the money and the girls","will be happy here with","their property. They won't suffer","at all.\" The king continued","to talk like this until","the duke finally agreed to","stay for the funeral and","to sell the property.","The duke said that he","was uncomfortable about the doctor, though.","\"Forget the doctor,\" said the king.","\"We have all the fools","in this town on our","side, and that's most of","the people.\" They started to","leave the room, when the","duke said, \"I don't think","that we've hidden the money","in a good place.\"","\"What's wrong with where the","money is hidden?\" \"Mary Jane","may send her black slave","into this room to get","some dresses for her.","Do you think a slave","can find a bag of","money and not borrow some","of it?\" \"You're correct this","time, duke.\" And the king","began looking among the dresses","only a few feet away","from where I was hidden.","I stood absolutely still—I didn't","move a muscle. I wondered","what they would have done","to me if they had","discovered me. But the king","found the bag of gold","before he found me.","He pushed the bag under","the blan­ kets of his bed.","Then they left the room.","As soon as I heard","the sound of their feet","on the stairs, I came","out of my hiding place,","took the bag of gold,","and returned to my own","small room. I knew that","I would have to think","of a good place to","hide the gold, but where?","If I hid it inside","the house, they would surely","search everywhere and find it,","once they realized that it","was no longer in the","king's bed. I stayed awake","until I heard the king","and the duke come upstairs.","I waited to see if","the king would notice that","the gold was gone, but","I heard nothing. I waited","in my room until the","house was completely quiet, then","I walked slowly and quietly","down the stairs. The house","was quiet. I opened the","dining room doors lightly and","could see men sitting in chairs.","They were asleep. I walked","slowly into the living room","where the body of Peter","Wilks lay. Suddenly, I heard","someone coming down the stairs.","I didn't know what to do.","There was no place for","me to run. I quickly","hid the bag of gold","dollars under the body of","Peter Wilks. His body was","so cold that I felt","sick with fear. Then I","ran across the room and","hid behind a door.","The person coming was Mary Jane.","She walked softly toward the","body of her uncle and","sat down beside it.","She held a handkerchief to","her face and was crying.","Her back was toward me.","Quietly, I moved out of","my hiding place and returned","to my room. I knew","that I had not hidden","the money well. If it","would stay hid­ den with","the body, there would be","no problem. Once we were","far away, I would, simply","write to Mary Jane and","tell her to get them","to dig up the body","and recover the money.","However, what would happen if","the money was discovered before","the body was buried?","The king would get it","again, of course, and he","would guard it so closely","that I could never hope","to steal it again.","I knew that I should","try to move the money","to a safer place, but","I was afraid that I","would be caught if I","attempted to do so.","The next day the family","began to make preparations for","the funer­ al. The coffin,","with Peter Wilks's body in","it, was placed on several","chairs in the middle of","the room. The rest of","the room was filled with","rows and rows of chairs,","which extended into the dining","room and hall. Neighbors and","friends from the town began","to arrive. Soon all the","chairs were full. I had","hoped to move the money","to a safer hiding place,","but knew I could not","do that with so many","people watching. The king, the","duke, and the three girls","sat in the first row","of chairs. They all held","handkerchiefs to their eyes and","kept their heads bent down.","The only sound was that","of quiet crying and the","noises made by men blowing","their noses—people always blow their","noses more at a funeral","than at any other time.","The man in charge of","the funeral moved noiselessly through","the crowd like a cat.","He never spoke; he moved","people around, made space for","those who arrived late, and","made certain that everyone was","com­ fortable, but he did","this all with nods and","signs with his hands, not words.","When he was satisfied that","all was ready, he stood","against the wall. The three","sisters had borrowed a piano—a","sick one. A young woman","sat down and played a","sad song and everyone joined","in singing. After the song","ended, the Reverend Hobson began","his talk in a slow,","low voice. Suddenly, there was","a terrible noise in the basement.","The noise was made by","a dog, but it was","the loudest, meanest dog that","I had ever seen.","Reverend Hobson refused to notice","the noise and continued talk­","ing about the dead man.","Finally, the noise became so","loud that he had to","stop talking. No one seemed","to know what to do.","The man in charge of","the funeral moved from his","position against the wall.","He made a sign to","Hobson as if to say,","\"Don't worry—depend on me.\"","Then he moved smoothly and","easily along the wall, all","the while not making a sound.","All eyes in the room","followed his move­ ments.","The noise in the basement","grew louder and louder.","Finally, the man disappeared behind","the door leading to the basement.","We heard a loud whack,","then a loud dog cry,","and all was still.","Hobson continued his talk.","In a few minutes, the","man returned from the basement,","again moved smoothly and easily","along the wall, returned to","the same spot where he","had been standing before, and","said in a loud whisper,","\"He had a rat!\"","You could see that this","was a great satisfaction to","the people because naturally they","had wondered what was troubling","the dog. A small, helpful","act like that was what","made this man so well­liked","in town. When the Reverend","Hobson had finished talking, the","man in charge of the","funeral left his position against","the wall and came over","to the coffin and closed","the top. I didn't know","if anyone had discov­ ered","the money. Was it really","going to be buried with","Peter Wilks? After they had","buried Peter Wilks, we returned","to the house. I began","to watch the faces of","the king and the duke","to see what I could learn.","Did they know that the","money was gone? Their faces","told me nothing. They sat","in the evening, talking to","the people who were still","at the house. The king","said that they were eager","to return to England, and","would have to sell the","property immediately. He said that","he and his brother would","be happy to take the","girls home to England with them.","The girls were so happy","at the thought of moving","to England that they forgot","about losing their uncle.","It made my heart sick","to see them being lied","to again. The very next","day, the king decided to","sell the house, the tannery,","and the black slaves.","The slaves were being sold","immediately— the two sons were","sold to a family living","up the river in Memphis,","Tennessee, and their mother was","sold down the river to","New Orleans. The three sisters","and the black slaves cried","and cried when the time","came for them to separate.","The girls said that they","never realized that the slaves","would be sold away from","the town. Many people in","the town were angry that","the mother and her two","sons were going to be","sepa­ rated in this way.","The following morning the king","and the duke entered my","room very early and I","knew that there was trouble.","\"Were you in my room","two nights ago?\" asked the king.","\"No, I wasn't even near","your room since the girls","took us there that first day.\"","\"Well, did you see anyone","go in there?\" \"Not that","I can remember.\" \"Stop and think.\"","\"Well, I did see two","black slaves go in there","on the day of the funeral.","I was walking down the","stairs and I saw them","go in the king's room.\"","\"What did they do in there?\"","\"Nothing that I could see.","I thought that they were","simply clean­ ing the room.\"","The duke had a strange","smile on his face.","\"Those black slaves have tricked us.","They cried and made a","scene about having been sold","away from this town, but","that was simply an act.\"","\"Is something wrong?\" I asked.","\"This is not any business","of yours. You keep your","mouth shut. You know nothing","about any of this.\"","Then the duke shouted at","the king, \"This is your fault.","I knew that we should","have left with the money.","But you wanted to wait","until you sold the property.\"","The king did not like","these remarks and said the","fault was mine. He said","that I should have come","to him immediately when I","saw the black slaves leave","his room. I didn't mind","his saying this. I knew","that they wouldn't try to","search for the money and","they really couldn't harm the","black slaves either. The next","morning, as I was walking","down the stairs, I heard","the sound of someone crying.","The door to Mary Jane's","room was open, and I","could see her sitting by","her open trunk. She had","been packing her clothes for","the trip to England.","But now she stopped packing","and sat with her face","in her hands, crying.","I felt very sad to","see her like this.","I entered her room and","said, \"Miss Mary Jane, I","hate to see peo­ ple","feeling sad. Tell me what","troubles you.\" She said that","she was crying because of","the black slaves. She said","that the beautiful trip to","England was ruined for her","and that she could never","be happy in England knowing","that the black mother and","her two children would never","see each other again.","Then she threw out her","arms and cried, \"Oh, oh!","They'll be separated forever.\"","\"But they will get together again.","I know that they will!\"","I assured her. I had","said that before I could think.","And before I could say","an­ other word, she put","her arms around me and","kissed me and told me","to say that again, and","again, and again! I knew","that I had made a","mistake to say what I","had said, and told her","that I needed a minute","to think. In the past,","I had never told the","truth when I was in","a difficult situation, but this","time it seemed to me","that the truth would actually","be safer than a lie.","I decided to take a","chance and tell the truth","this time and hope all","would turn out well.","I said to her, \"Miss","Mary Jane, is there any","place out of town where","you could stay for three","or four days?\" \"Yes, I","could visit Mr. Lothrop.","Why?\" \"I can't tell you yet.","I'll assure you that the","black slaves will see each","other again soon—within two weeks—if","you'll visit Mr. Lothrop and","stay four days.\" \"Four days!","I would be happy to","stay a whole year if","I could be assured that","our slaves will be united again.\"","I stood up and closed","her bedroom door, then returned","to her and said quietly,","\"I'll tell you the truth.","This will not be pleasant","but I can't change that.","Those two men are not","your uncles; they have simply","been tricking you. They're here","to steal your money.","I've told you the worst;","the rest is not so bad.\"","She was very troubled by","what I had said, but","I knew that I had","to tell her the complete truth.","I told her about the","boy we had met who","told us about Peter Wilks","and about the people in","the town. I told her","how the king and the","duke had made the plans","to trick her and her","sis­ ters. And I told","her that they did not","intend to take her and","her sisters to England.","She jumped up angrily and","said that she wanted the","people of the town to","be told the truth, too.","But I reminded her of","her promise to visit Mr.","Lothrop for four days, and","she said that she would","keep her promise. Once I","had said those things, I","thought of a new plan.","I could see there was","a way for Jim and","me to escape if the","king and the duke were","put into prison. \"Miss Mary","Jane, I have a new plan.","This plan won't require you","to stay at the Lothrops","for four days. I want","you to leave immediately and","stay the day there.","At nine o'clock tonight, tell","them that you have forgotten","something and must return home.","If you arrive here before","eleven o'clock, put a lighted","candle in the window.","If I see the candle,","I'll come to you.","If I don't come to","you, you will know that","I am on my raft","and have gone away.","Only then should you tell","the men of this town","that the king and the","duke are not really your uncles.\"","\"I'll do that,\" she answered.","\"If I escape on the","raft, I won't be here","to prove that those two","men are not your uncles.","There are people in other","towns who can tell you","of the tricks that those","two have played before.","I will write down the","names of the towns and","you can talk to people there.","When the court wants to","learn what type of men","they are, I'm sure men","from those towns will be","happy to tell the court.\"","I hoped that she understood","exactly what she had to do.","Then I continued, \"Let them","sell your property. Don't worry","about that. No one will","pay for the property immediately,","and the king and the","duke are not going to","leave until they have all","the money.\" \"I'll go down","to breakfast now, and leave","for the Lothrops imme­ diately","after I've eaten.\" \"Don't wait","until after breakfast. Leave now!","Why do you think that","I've asked you to leave","at all?\" \"I have no idea.","Why do you want me","to leave?\" \"Because you're not","able to keep a secret.\"","\"What about my sisters?","Are they safe with those two?\"","\"They'll be safe enough.","I'll tell them that you","have gone to visit someone","who's sick and that you","should return tonight or tomorrow morning.\"","\"I feel sad to think","that I gave them that","bag of gold dollars.\"","\"But they don't have it.","I had it because I","stole it from them to","give to you. But I","don't have it any longer.","I'm sorry, Miss Mary Jane.","I'm very sorry. I did","the best I could.","I had to hide it","quickly and did­ n't hide","it in a good place.\"","\"Oh, stop blaming yourself.","But where did you hide it?\"","\"I would rather not tell","you where I put the","money, but I'll write it","for you on a piece","of paper, and you can","read it as you travel","to Mr. Lothrop's house.\"","I wrote: \"I put the","money in the coffin with","Peter Wilks's body. It was","there when you were crying","that night. I was hiding","behind the door. I felt","very sorry for you, Miss","Mary Jane.\" She took the","paper, then she said to","me, \"Good­bye. I'll do every­","thing that you've told me.","If I don't see you","again, I want you to","know that I'll never forget you.","I'll pray for you, too\"—and","she was gone. Later, when","I saw Susan, I said","to her, \"Mary Jane has","gone across the river to","visit the Proctors. One of","them is very sick.\"","\"What kind of sickness is it?\"","\"There's no name for it,","but it's very serious.","The family sat up with","her all night, and they","don't think that she has","much longer to live.\"","\"That's awful. I must tell","Uncle Harvey immediately.\" \"Don't tell him.\"","\"Why not?\" \"Would your Uncle","Harvey be willing to take","Mary Jane on the long","boat ride to England if","he thought that she might","become very ill with the","same sickness that the Proctor","girl has? Of course he wouldn't.","I think that a better","idea is to tell your","uncle that Mary Jane has","gone across the river to","tell your friends, the Lothrops,","that your house and the","tannery are going to be sold.","You can say that Mary","Jane is certain that the","Lothrops would be interested in","buying the house because Peter","Wilks had said that he","would prefer the Lothrops to","own it.\" I felt very","good about the work that","I had done that day.","I was certain that Tom","Sawyer could not have done","it better himself. Of course,","Tom's plans would have been","fancier, but my plans have","always had to be simple","and realistic because that's the","way I was raised.","They sold all the property","and furniture by the end","of the after­ noon.","As they were finishing the","sale, a large boat stopped","to unload its passengers.","Minutes later, a crowd ran","up the street laughing and","calling in loud voices, \"Here","is a second set of","brothers of Peter Wilks!\"","The crowd was leading a","nice-looking old gentleman and a","nice-­looking younger gentleman, whose arm","was wrapped in a white","cloth and appeared to be broken.","The people in the crowd","were shout­ ing and laughing,","but this did not seem","like a joke to me.","I knew that the duke","and the king would see","nothing to joke about either.","I expect­ ed them to","turn pale and look frightened,","but they didn't. The king","simply looked in a sorrowful","manner at the two strangers","as though it pained his","heart to see such awful liars.","Several men stood next to","the king to let him","know that they believed he","was the true brother.","The older of the two","strangers spoke like this to","the crowd: \"I wasn't expecting","to find two men here","who claim to be brothers","to Peter Wilks. I'm not","in a good position to","prove that we're the real","brothers, for our traveling bags","with our belongings in them","were mistakenly taken off the","boat in a town further","up the river. But I'm","Peter Wilks's brother, Harvey, and","this is his brother, William.","He can't hear or speak","and can't make signs with","his hands since one arm","is broken. We are who","we say we are, and","in a day or two,","when we get our bags,","we can prove it.","But until that time, I'll","say nothing more; we'll go","to our hotel and wait.\"","The king laughed and said,","\"Broke his arm—not likely.","But how convenient. Now he","has a good excuse for","not expressing himself through signs,","which, of course, he has","never learned. Lost their bags!","Another convenient excuse.\" The king","laughed again, and so did","most of the men in","the crowd, except for three","or four, or maybe half","a dozen. One of those","who did not laugh was","the doctor; another was a","sharp­looking gentleman who had just","come off the boat and","was talking to the doctor","in a low voice.","They would glance toward the","king and nod their heads.","This was Levi Bell, the","lawyer who had been visiting","in Louisville. Another stranger, who","was not laughing, now spoke","to the king: \"If you","are Harvey Wilks, when did","you arrive in this town?\"","\"The day before the funeral,","friend,\" said the king.","\"At what time of day?\"","\"In the evening—about an hour","or two before sunset.\"","\"How did you travel?\"","\"We came on the big","passenger boat from Cincinnati.\"","\"Well, how did it happen","that I saw you in","a canoe that very morning","near where I live?\"","\"I was not in a","canoe that morning.\" \"That is","a lie!\" Several men jumped","up and attempted to quiet him.","They said that he should","not talk that way to","an old man. \"He's a liar.","I saw him that morning","in a canoe with Tim","Collins and another boy.\"","\"Would you recognize the boy","if you were to see","him again?\" \"I'm not certain,","but perhaps I would.","I see him standing there now.","I recognize him perfectly.\"","It was me that he","pointed to. The doctor spoke next:","\"Neighbors, I don't know whether","the two new men are","the true Wilks brothers or","not, but these two here","surely are not. I think","that it is our duty","to keep them in this","town until we can prove","which men are speaking the truth.","Come, all of you.","We'll take these two fellows","and the boy to the","hotel and question them along","with the other two.\"","The crowd started toward the hotel.","It was nearly sundown by now.","The doctor led me along","by the hand. He was","kind to me but he","never let go of my hand.","When we reached the hotel,","the doctor asked the two","men to meet with us","to discuss the problem.","He said, \"I don't wish","to cause problems, but I","would feel better if we","had the bag of gold","that Peter Wilks left.","I would not want friends","of these two men to","attempt to leave town with","the gold while we're talking here.\"","Everyone agreed that it was","a good idea. I wondered","how the king would deal","with this new problem.","But he simply looked sorrowful","and said, \"Gentlemen, I wish","that the money was here,","for I would like to","help you in every way","that I can. But I","can't produce the money.\"","\"Where is it, then?\"","\"When my niece gave me","the bag of money to","keep for her, I hid","it in my bed.","I thought that would be","a safe place, but one","of the black slaves stole it.","When I sold the slaves,","I had not yet realized","that the money was stolen,","so I didn't question them","about it. They've taken the","money down to New Orleans","with them. My servant here","can tell you about it.\"","I could see that the","doctor and several of the","others did not be­ lieve him.","One man asked me if","I saw one of the","slaves steal the money, and","I said no, but I","did see them leaving the","room quickly, and they seemed","to be acting in a","guilty manner. Then the doctor","turned to me and said,","\"Are you English, too?\"","I said yes, and he","and some others laughed and","I knew that they didn't","believe me. They began seriously","questioning the king and the","other gentle­ man who also","claimed that he was Harvey Wilks.","They questioned them for hour","after hour, and no one","thought about supper or how","late it was. They asked","the king to repeat his","story again, and then they","asked the other Harvey Wilks","to repeat what he had","said earlier. The longer that","I listened to the two","men, the more I was","certain that most of the","men knew that the king","was telling a lie while","the other man was telling","the truth. Finally, they asked","me to tell what I knew.","The king gave me a","long, meaningful look, and I","knew that I must tell","a good story. I began","to tell about the town","of Sheffield and about the","Wilks family there, but I","had not said much when","the doctor began to laugh.","Levi Bell, the lawyer, said,","\"Sit down, boy. You can","stop talking. You're not accustomed","to lying and don't do","it well. You need to","have more practice if you're","going to be a good liar.\"","The king and Levi Bell","then talked quietly for a","few minutes. The lawyer asked","the king to write a","few words on a sheet","of paper. Then he spoke","to the duke—who looked quite","sick—and asked him to write","a few sentences, too.","Last, he turned to the","other two men who claimed","to be the Wilks brothers","and asked them to write","a few lines and sign","their names. The old man","wrote, but nobody could read","his writing. The lawyer looked","at what all three men","had written and acted surprised.","Then he took several old","letters out of his pocket","and exam­ ined them.","Then he examined the old","man's writing again. Finally, he","said, \"These letters were written","by Harvey Wilks. If you","compare the handwriting in these","letters to the lines these","men have written, you'll see","that they are not alike.","Not any of these men","wrote these letters. (The king","and the duke looked foolish","when they realized how the","lawyer had tricked them.)","The old gentleman said, \"Please,","let me explain. Nobody can","read my handwriting but my","brother William here. When I","write a letter, he copies","it for me and we","mail his copy. You have","his letters, in your hand,","not mine.\" \"Well,\" said the","lawyer, \"I have some letters","here signed by William, also,","so if you'll ask him","to write a few lines,","we can compare the hand­ writing.","\"He can't write with his","left hand,\" said the old gentleman.","\"If he could use his","right hand, which you see","is broken, you would know","that he wrote his own","and my letters, too.","Look at both letters.","Compare the handwriting. You'll see","that the writing is the same.\"","The lawyer compared the letters","and said, \"I believe that's true.","The handwriting in the letters","signed Harvey is very similar","to the hand­ writing in","the letters signed William.","I hadn't noticed that before.","This still doesn't absolutely prove","that you're the true brothers,","but one thing is proved—neither","of these other two are","Wilkses\"—and he nodded his head","toward the king and the duke.","The old gentleman who claimed","to be Harvey Wilks suddenly","spoke, \"I've thought of something.","Is there anyone here who","saw my brother's body after","he died?\" \"Yes,\" answered a man.","\"Ab Turner and I did.","We're both here.\" Then the","old gentleman turned to the","king and said, \"Perhaps this","man can tell me what","was tattooed on his chest.\"","I wondered how the king","would answer this. There was","no way he could know","what was tattooed on that","man's chest. His face turned white;","he couldn't control that.","It was very quiet in","the room; every­ one moved","a little closer and stared","at the king. I knew","that the king would now","have to admit that he","was lying. That was the","only thing that he could do.","Or was it? I could","hardly believe what I was hearing.","The king smiled and began","to speak very slowly.","\"That is a difficult question.","Yes, I can tell you","what is tattooed on Peter","Wilks's chest— simply a small,","thin, blue arrow. The tattoo","is faint, and you must","look very closely to see it.\"","The old gentleman turned to","Ab Turner and his friend","and said, \"You heard what","this man said. Was there","a tattoo like the one","described on Peter's chest?\"","Both of them answered, \"We","didn't see such a tattoo.\" \"Good!\"","said the old gentleman.","\"The tattoo on his chest","were the letters P, B,","and W—the first letters of","his name. They're not very","clear, but, if you looked","closely, you should have been","able to see them.","I'm certain that's the tattoo","that you saw.\" The crowd","was getting excited now.","Several men shouted, \"All of","them are lying. Let's force","them all to leave this town.\"","Suddenly, the lawyer jumped onto","the table and shouted, \"Gentle­","men, gentlemen! Listen to me. Please!","We can still prove if","these men are liars.","We have to go to","the graveyard and dig up","the body of Peter Wilks","and look at his chest.\" \"Hooray!\"","they all shouted and started","to leave the hotel.","\"Wait!\" shouted the doctor.","\"Seize these four men and","the boy, too. Don't let","them run away. Bring them","to the graveyard.\" I was","very frightened, but I couldn't escape.","Several men grasped each of","us and made us walk","with them to the graveyard.","To make the situation worse,","I noticed that the night","sky was very black and","light­ ning was beginning to flash.","This was the most frightening","situation that I had ever","been in. I wished that","Mary Jane were at home","and could save me.","What would happen when they","did not find the blue","arrow tat­ too mark?","I didn't want to think","about that, yet somehow I","could think of nothing else.","The night was getting darker","as the storm approached.","It would have been a","good time to escape except","that a huge man held","tightly to my arm.","He nearly dragged me along","by the arm; he was","so excited to get to","the graveyard. Many men had","brought tools for dig­ ging.","They soon located Peter Wilks's","grave and began the job","of dig­ ging up the body.","No one had brought a","light, so they worked in","dark­ ness. The rain started","and a strong wind began","to blow. Suddenly, the lightning","flashed more frequently, followed by","loud thunder. The crowd moved","in close, with everyone pushing","to get a better view.","Suddenly, a huge flash of","lightning made the dark night","as bright as day.","The coffin lid was lifted,","and someone shouted, \"Look!","Here's the bag of gold!\"","Everyone in the crowd was","surprised by this unexpected event.","The man who held my","arm suddenly threw up his","hands in surprise, and I","was free. It was my","chance to escape, and I","began to run as fast","as I could. I was","the only person on the","road and I was running","so fast that I felt","like I was flying.","As I ran past the","Wilks's house, I could see","the lighted candle in Mary","Jane's window and I felt happy.","She was the best girl","that I had ever known.","As soon as I reached","the river above the town,","I looked for a canoe","to borrow. The first time","the lightning showed me one","that was not tied to","a tree, I jumped in","and began to row toward","the raft. As soon as","I saw the raft, I","shouted to Jim, \"Hurry.","Untie the raft. We can","escape without the king and","the duke.\" Jim was so","happy to see me that","he cried for joy.","He held me in his","arms and was ready to","have a good, long cry,","but I said that we","had no time for that.","\"Cut the rope and let's","start down the river.\"","In two seconds, the rope","was cut and we were","moving with the river current.","It was good to be","free again and all by","ourselves on the big river.","No one would trouble us now.","Suddenly, I heard a sound","that was very familiar to","me—the sound of someone rowing","a boat. When the next","flash of lightning burst across","the sky, I saw a","small boat hurrying toward us.","In it were the king","and the duke. I fell","down onto the deck of","the raft. I wanted to","stop living and simply cry.","When the King and the","Duke got into the raft,","the King shook me by","the shoulders and shouted, \"Trying","to get away without us,","were you? Are you tired","of having us with you?\"","\"No, Your Majesty,\" I said.","\"Please don't hurt me.\"","\"Quick, then, tell us what","you were doing, or I'll","shake the insides out of you.\"","\"I'll be honest with you","and tell you everything exactly","as it hap­ pened.","A huge man was holding","my arm very tightly and","said that he was sorry","to see a boy in","such a serious situation.","Then they all were so","surprised to find the bag","of gold that he let","go of my arm and","whis­ pered, ‘Run now, or","they'll certainly hang you.'","I could see no good","reason for me to stay","and I didn't want to","be hanged if I could","avoid it. I ran as","fast as I could and","never stopped running until I","found a canoe. I rowed","to the raft and told","Jim to hurry. I was","certain that you and the","duke had already been hanged.","Jim and I felt very","sad and we certain­ ly","were happy to see you","two coming in your boat.","Ask Jim. He'll tell you","that I'm telling the truth.\"","Jim said that those were","the facts—that everything that I","had said was the truth.","The king said that he","did not believe a word","of what I had said","and was going to kill","me, but the duke told","him to take his hands","off me. \"You're a fool.","You know that you would","have done the same thing","if you were in his situation.","Did you ask anyone in","the crowd what had happened","to him? I didn't hear","you if you did.\"","The king stopped shaking me","and began to complain about","the town and everyone in it.","But the duke said, \"You","have no one to blame","but yourself for the problems","that we now have.","You refused to listen to","any advice that I offered.","The only smart thing that","you said was about the tattoo.","That's what saved us.","That got us to the","graveyard where they dug up","the body and found the","bag of gold. It was","only then that the excited","fools let go of us,","and we were able to","run away.\" They were both","quiet for a moment, thinking.","Then the king said, \"And","we thought the slaves had","stolen the money.\" \"Yes,\" said","the duke slowly, \"we thought that.\"","After about a half minute,","the king said slowly, \"That's","what I thought, anyway.\"","\"I'm not certain that I","agree with you. I thought","that the money was stolen","by the slaves. I don't","know what you thought.\"","The king was beginning to","sound angry. \"What do you","mean by that?\" \"And what","did you mean earlier?","You sound as though you","don't believe me.\" \"Perhaps you","were asleep and didn't know","what you were doing,\" said","the king. The duke was","very angry now. \"Do you","think that I'm a fool?","Do you think that I","don't know who hid that","bag of money?\" \"Of course","you know who hid it,\"","shouted the king. \"You hid","it yourself.\" \"That's a lie!\"","And the duke jumped at","him and tightened his hands","around the king's throat.","\"Take your hands off my throat!\"","\"Tell the truth. Admit that","you hid the money and","had planned to return later","to dig it up.","You planned to keep the","complete 6,000 dollars and not","share it with me.\"","\"I can't believe what I'm hearing!","Tell the truth, duke.","Say that you honestly did","not hide the money and","I'll believe you. And I","promise that I'll never again","accuse you of stealing it.\"","\"You know perfectly well that","I didn't take the money.\"","\"I believe you, duke.","But I want to ask","one question—and don't get angry","with me. Did you ever","think about stealing the money","and hiding it?\" \"It doesn't","matter what I may have","thought about doing. I did","not actually steal the money","and you did.\" \"I won't","say that I never thought","about taking the money because","I did think about it.","But you—I mean somebody—stole the","money before I could take it.\"","\"You're lying! You stole the","money and you have to","admit it.\" Then the duke","began to tighten his hands","around the king's throat.","The king began to make","strange sounds and his face","turned bright red. With his","last breath, the king said,","\"I admit it.\" The duke","took his hands away from","the king's throat. \"If you","ever deny that again I'll","kill you. Don't cry like","a baby now. You're the","cause of our problems.","I trusted you like you","were my own father.","Now they not only have","Peter Wilks's money returned to","them, but they have our","money also. We have almost","no money now. Go to bed.","I don't want to hear","you speak again tonight.\"","The king went to bed","and took a bottle of","whiskey with him for comfort.","The duke had his own","bottle of whiskey, and soon","they were both very drunk","and asleep in each other's arms.","Now that the king had","admitted taking the bag of","money, I didn't have to","worry that somehow it would","be discovered that I had","actually hidden the money.","Once I was certain that","they both were asleep, I","told Jim everything that had happened.","We dared not stop at","any town for days and days;","we simply continued traveling down","the river. We were in","the Deep South now— a","long distance from the town","where Peter Wilks had lived—and","the weather was hot.","The duke and king felt","that it was safe to","begin to visit small towns","along the river again.","In one small town, they","gave a speech about the","evils of drinking whiskey, but","this didn't earn them enough","money to buy a bottle","of whiskey for themselves.","In another small town, they","organized a danc­ ing school,","but they knew little about","dancing and soon the people","forced them to leave the town.","They tried many other tricks","in many other small towns,","but with little success.","They simply weren't able to","earn much money. Finally, they","had spent the last of","their money and had no more.","They simply lay on the","raft as we floated down","the river, thinking and thinking","and never saying a word.","That was the first time","that we had seen them","in such low spirits and","without hope. After several days","of this, Jim and I","noticed a change in their manner.","They would sit together in","the small tent on the","raft and talk quietly for","two and three hours at","a time. We had no","idea what they were talking","about, but we were very uneasy.","We feared that they were","planning a new trick of","some kind that would be","even worse than those that","they had played before.","Jim and I promised each","other that if we ever","had the opportunity, we would","escape from these two.","Early one morning, we hid","the raft in a good,","safe place about two miles","below a small town named Pikesville.","The king went ashore and","told us to remain hidden","while he went into town","to see if there was","a way we could earn","some money and to learn","if anyone had heard about us.","He said that if he","didn't return by noon, the","duke and I would know","that it was safe for","us to follow him.","We remained on the raft","and waited. The duke was","angry and complained about everything","that Jim and I did.","Nothing we did could please him.","I was happy when noon","finally arrived and we could","go to the village to","find the king. The duke","and I searched for him","for quite a while before","we found him very drunk","in the back room of","a store. Other drunks were","laughing at him, which made","the king very angry, but","he was too drunk to","do anything about this.","The duke was very angry","with the king, and loudly","told him so. He called","the king an old fool,","and the king called the","duke names that were even worse.","While they were arguing and","shouting at each other, I","saw my chance to escape","and ran as fast as","I could to the raft.","I knew that this was","the opportunity that Jim and","I had been waiting for.","I knew that if we","left without them this time,","it would be a long","day before they would see","Jim and me again.","I reached the raft filled","with joy and shouted, \"Cut","the rope, Jim. We can escape.","I ran away from the duke.\"","But all was quiet;","no one answered and no","one came out of the","tent on the raft.","Jim was gone! I shouted","and shouted and shouted some more.","I ran among the trees","and searched everywhere for him.","Jim was gone. Then I","sat down and cried.","I couldn't control my tears.","After a while, I stood","up and began to walk","toward the town. I met","a boy on the road","and asked him if he","had seen a black man","dressed in certain clothes (I","described the clothes Jim had","been wear­ing when I last","saw him). He answered, \"Yes,","I saw him. He's at","Silas Phelps's farm two miles","from here. He's a runaway","slave, and they've caught him.","There's a two hundred dollar","reward for him, and they'll","keep him until they get","the reward money.\" \"Who caught him?\"","\"An old man—a stranger—he sold","his chance to collect the","re­ ward to Silas Phelps","for only forty dollars.","He says that he has","to travel up the river","and cannot wait to collect","the two hundred dollars.","Can you imagine not waiting","for two hundred dollars?\"","\"I wonder why he was","willing to sell his chance","for the reward for only","forty dollars. That's very cheap.","Are you certain that the","reward is lawful?\" \"It is.","I saw the printed notice myself.","The notice describes the runaway","slave exactly. And it tells","the name of his owner","in New Orleans.\" I returned","to the raft and sat","in the tent to think.","I couldn't decide what I","should do. I thought and","thought, but couldn't see how","to solve this new problem.","After all this long journey,","and after all Jim and","I had done for the","duke and the king, I","couldn't believe that they played","such a mean trick on Jim.","How could they have caused","Jim to become a slave","again—after his months of freedom—for","forty dirty dollars! I said","to myself that it would","be a thousand times better","for Jim to return to","Miss Watson, so I decided","to write a letter to","Tom Sawyer ask­ ing him","to tell Miss Watson where","she could find Jim.","But then I thought about","this a second time.","I knew that Jim would","be hated for having run","away and he would probably","be sold down the river","to New Orleans anyway.","Also, when my old friends","discovered that I helped Jim","escape, I wouldn't be able","to feel comfortable around them anymore.","So many thoughts were in","my mind at the same","time that I couldn't decide","what to do. I tried","to pray, but I couldn't","find the right words to use.","I knew that the correct","thing to do would be","to return Jim to Miss","Watson and I knew that","I should pray for help","to do this. But I","also knew deep down inside","of me that I would","never be able to do","this to Jim, and I","knew that God knew I","wouldn't be able to do this.","A person can't pray a","lie—I learned that. I felt","so troubled and didn't know","what I should do.","Then I had an idea.","Perhaps if I wrote a","letter to Miss Watson, I","would feel better and my","troubles would be gone.","I got a piece of","paper and a pencil and wrote:","Miss Watson: Your runaway slave","Jim is two miles below","Pikesville on the Mississippi River. Mr.","Silas Phelps has him and","will return him to you","for a two hundred dollar reward.","Huck Finn Suddenly, I felt","good, as though I had","been washed clean. Then I","began to think about the","trip Jim and I had","taken down the river.","I could see Jim in","my mind—Jim in the day","and in the night, Jim","in the moonlight and Jim","in a storm. Sometimes we","were talking or singing or laughing.","All I could remember were","the good things Jim had","done for me and how","he had said that I","was the best friend that","he had in the world.","And then I thought again","of the letter that I","had just writ­ ten, and","my hands began to shake.","I knew that I had","to decide forever between two things.","I thought for a moment,","almost without breath­ ing, and","then said to myself, \"I","don't care if I go","to hell\"—and tore the letter","into many pieces. Those were","awful thoughts and awful words,","but they were said.","I knew that I wouldn't","change my mind again.","I knew that I had","to begin to work on","a plan for stealing Jim","out of slavery. I decided","to sleep on the raft.","The next morning, after breakfast,","I put on my best","clothes, got into the canoe,","and rowed to the shore.","I hid the canoe and","began to search for the","Phelps farm. I walked along","a road and soon passed","a mill with a sign","on it that said, \"Phelps's Sawmill.\"","When I came to a","farmhouse near the mill, I","could see no one in","the yard or around the house.","I didn't want to see","anyone yet—I simply wanted to","see what the farmhouse looked","like and exactly where it was.","I returned to the road","and started to walk to","the town. The first person","that I met was the duke.","He was nailing printed signs","onto trees along the road.","The signs told about a","show that he and the","king were going to put on.","It was going to be","the same show in which","the king was painted in","bright colors and danced completely naked.","Those fools were going to","try that old trick again.","The duke was very surprised","to see me and said, \"Hello!","Where did you come from?","Where's the raft? Have you","hidden it well?\" \"That's what","I planned to ask you.\"","\"Why would you ask me?\"","said the duke, slowly.","\"Well, yesterday when I saw","the king so drunk, I","said to myself that we","wouldn't be leaving for many hours.","So I offered to help","a man in the town","with his sheep and that","took most of the day.","When it was getting dark,","I returned to the raft","and found that it was gone.","I said to myself that","you and the king must","have gotten into trouble and","had to leave quickly, taking","my slave Jim with you.","I slept in the forest","last night. What did happen","to the raft?—and Jim—where's Jim?\"","\"I don't know what happened","to the raft. The king—old","fool that he is—made a","trade and got forty dollars","and spent much of it","on whiskey and lost the rest.","When we returned to the","raft last night, we found","that it was gone.","We thought that you had","continued traveling down the river","and simply left us here.\"","\"I wouldn't leave Jim, would I?","He was my slave and","the only property that I own.\"","\"We never thought of that.","We had come to consider","Jim our slave. Yes, we","certainly thought that he was ours.","We had plenty of trou­","ble protecting him and hiding him.\"","Then he asked me for","some money, and I gave","him ten cents. I had","a lot of money, but","I told him that ten","cents was all I had.","I told him to buy","food with the ten cents","and to give me some","because I hadn't eaten anything","since the day before.","He then looked at me","with fear in his eyes","and said, \"Do you think","that Jim will tell people","in this town about our play?","We'll kill him if he does.\"","\"How can he tell about","the play? I thought that","he ran away.\" \"No!","The king—fool that he is—sold him.","And he never gave me","any of the money, and","the money is gone.\"","\"Sold him?\" I said, and","began to cry. \"He was","my slave and the money","should be mine. Where is he?","I want my slave.\"","\"You can't have your slave,","so stop crying about him.","Do you plan to tell","the people in this town","about us? If you were","to tell—\" \"I don't plan","to tell anything. I have","no time for that.","I need to find my Jim.\"","The duke stood thinking for","a while. At last he","said, \"We have to be","here for three days to","earn money on this show.","If you promise not to","tell the men of this","town about us, I'll tell","you where to find Jim.\"","I promised. \"A farmer by","the name of Silas Ph—\"","and then he stopped.","He started to tell me","the truth, but when he","stopped and began to think","about it, I knew that","he was changing his mind.","He wouldn't trust me.","He wanted to be certain","that I wouldn't be in","this town dur­ ing the","three days of the show.","He began a second time","to give me an answer.","\"The man who bought Jim","is named Abram Foster and","he lives forty miles down","this road, near a town","called Lafayette.\" \"I can walk","there in three days,\" I said.","\"I'll start this afternoon.\"","\"No, you won't. You'll begin now!","Don't waste any time and","don't talk to anyone along","the road. Walk quickly and","you won't get into any trouble.","Do you understand?\" I had","no problem understanding him.","Now I was free to","work on my own plans.","\"Start walking,\" the duke said, angrily.","\"Tell Mr. Foster whatever you please.","He may believe Jim is","your slave even though you","have no proof. Maybe he'll","believe that he was tricked","into thinking that he was","going to get a reward","for Jim. Tell Mr.","Foster anything—I don't care.","But don't speak to anyone","in this town.\" I began","to walk along the country","road for a mile or two.","When I knew that the","duke couldn't see me anymore,","I left the road and","ran through the forest to","the Phelps's farm. I needed","to talk to Jim.","I didn't want Jim telling","anyone about the king and","the duke. I want­ ed","no further trouble from them.","I was afraid of what","they might do to us","if we were to reveal","the truth about them.","When I arrived at the","Phelps's farm, all was quiet.","The black slaves were working","in the fields. I could","hear the quiet sound made","by bugs and flies;","this made the farm seem","so lonely. They raised cotton,","and the farm looked like","many other small farms that","I had seen in the South.","The farmhouse was large and","made of logs. Behind the","houses was a small building","used for smoking meat.","Behind this smokehouse were three","small log cabins where the","black slaves lived. Off by","itself, near the back fence,","stood a small log building.","I didn't know what it","was used for. I walked","toward the farmhouse, not certain","what I would say to","the people who lived in it.","As I neared the house,","a great number of dogs—perhaps","fifteen—came running toward me, barking","and jump­ ing and showing","their teeth. I stopped and","faced toward them and stood","very still. It was as","though I were the center","of a wheel with dogs","in a circle all around me.","A black slave woman came","out of the house and","shouted at the dogs, \"Go away!","All of you. Run off!\"","And she hit several of","them with a stick.","Behind the black woman, a","white woman came running from","the house. \"Is it you, finally?\"","she shouted. \"Yes,\" I answered,","without thinking. She put her","arms around me and kissed","me, with tears in her eyes.","\"You don't look as much","like your mother as I","expected, but I'm happy to","see you anyway. How are","you, Tom? Have you eaten breakfast?","Did you eat on the boat?\"","I said that I ate","on the boat. She then","led me to the house","and asked me to sit down.","\"I've waited many years to","see you, Tom. We expected","you a few days ago.","Why was your boat late?\"","I said that the boat","developed engine problems and we","were delayed. \"Why don't you","call me Aunt Sally?\"","she asked. \"Your Uncle Silas","has gone into town to","learn if you arrived.","He's been looking for you","for two days now.","He should return very soon.","You must have passed him","on the road.\" \"No, I","didn't see anyone, Aunt Sally.","The boat arrived at day­","break, and I hid my","traveling bags and decided to","walk to your house.\"","\"I'm surprised that you were","given breakfast on the boat","that early in the morning.","Usually they don't serve breakfast","until later. Are you certain","that you ate?\" I began","to fear that my lies","would be discovered. I needed","to find some children to","question if I were to","learn who I was supposed","to be. Who had this","woman been expecting? Mrs.","Phelps continued to talk in","her rapid manner. I hardly","lis­ tened to what she","was saying. Suddenly, a great","fear came over me as","I heard her say, \"Now","I'll stop talking for a","while and give you a chance.","I want to know everything","about my sister and about","all the others in your family—everything.","How are they? What are","they doing? What did they","tell you to tell me?","I'm ready to hear what","you have to say.\"","I didn't know what to say.","I simply had made no","plans for this. I could","think of nothing to say","and began to feel sick.","I opened my mouth to","begin to tell the truth,","when Mrs. Phelps suddenly pushed","me under the bed.","\"Here he comes,\" she whispered.","\"Stay hidden under this bed.","I don't want him to","see you. This will be","a great joke.\" I could","think of nothing to do","but follow her instructions.","I could hear someone enter","the house. Then Mrs.","Phelps said, \"Has he come?\"","\"No,\" said her husband.","\"What could possibly have happened","to him?\" \"I don't know,","but I'm beginning to feel","a little frightened.\" \"A little frightened?","I'm very frightened. Could you","have passed him on the","road and not realized it?\"","\"Sally, that could not have happened.","You know that.\" \"What will","my sister say? He should","be here. I'm certain that","you passed him on the","road without realizing it.\"","\"I'm also worried about him.","I have no idea where","he could be. He should","have been here several days ago.","I'm afraid something has happened","to his boat.\" \"Silas, look!","Up the road! I see","someone coming.\" When Silas ran","to the window to look","out, Mrs. Phelps pulled on","my legs and had me","come out from under the bed.","When he returned from the","window, there she stood, smiling","and smiling, while I simply","looked uncomfortable. The old man","stared at me and asked,","\"Who's that?\" \"Who do you","think it is?\" \"I have","no idea.\" \"It's Tom Sawyer.\"","I nearly fainted. But I","had no time to show","my surprise. The old man","took my hand and kept","shaking it, while his wife","danced around and laughed and cried.","Then they asked a dozen","questions about Sid and Mary","and all the other Sawyers.","If they felt joyful, that","was nothing to what I","was feeling. I felt like","I had been born again.","I was so happy to","discover who I was sup­","posed to be. In the","following two hours, I told","them more about my family—I","mean the Sawyer family—than ever","happened to any six Sawyer families.","And I told them my","boat had developed engine prob­lems","and that it took three","days before the engine was repaired.","I was feeling both very","comfortable and very uncomfortable.","It was easy to act","like Tom Sawyer because I","knew all about him and","his family. But, then I","heard the sounds of a","large boat on the river.","What will happen if Tom","Sawyer is on that boat?","What will happen if he","walks into this house and","calls out my name?","I simply could not allow","that to happen. I had","to meet him along the","road and tell him of","my problem. I told Mr.","Phelps that I would go","into town to get my","traveling bags that I had hidden.","He said that he would","go with me, but I","insisted that I could go alone.","I told him that I","had been trouble enough already.","I TOOK A HORSE AND","WAGON AND STARTED DOWN THE","ROAD TO THE town.","As I had expected, I","soon saw Tom Sawyer riding","in a wagon com­ ing","toward me. He jumped with","fear and surprise when he","saw me. \"I never did","you any harm when you","were alive, Huck. Why do","you return from the dead","to frighten me now?\"","\"I'm not a ghost.","I never died.\" When Tom","heard my voice, he seemed","less frightened. But he still","was not quite ready to","believe me. \"You're not playing","a trick on me, are you?","If I were dead, I'd","never return to play a","trick on you. I don't understand.","I thought that you had","been murdered.\" \"No, I wasn't murdered.","I played a trick to","make it look like I","was murdered. If you touch","me, you'll know that I'm","not a ghost.\" Tom touched","my hand and that satisfied him.","He was very happy to","see me again. He wanted","to know all about what","I had been doing and","all that had happened to me.","He thought that I must","have had a grand adventure.","Tom loved a mystery more","than anything in the world","and he loved a good story.","Tom asked the man who","was driving him in the","wagon to wait a few","minutes, and he climbed into","my wagon, and we drove","off a short distance so","that we could talk without","being heard. I told him","about Aunt Sally and how","she thought that I was","Tom Sawyer and asked his","advice on how to manage","this difficult situation. Tom thought","and thought and finally said,","\"I have a good plan.","Take my bags with my","clothes and put them in","your wagon. Pretend that they","are your clothes. I'll return","to the town and wait.","Then I'll come out to","Aunt Sally's house and time","my visit so as to","arrive thirty minutes after you.","Pretend that you don't know","who I am.\" \"Wait.","I need to tell you","one more fact—a fact that","no one knows but me.","There's a black man that","I'm trying to steal out","of slavery. His name is","Jim—old Miss Watson's Jim.\"","\"What! But Jim is—\" I","stopped him before he could finish.","\"I know what you're think­ ing.","You think that I shouldn't","be helping a runaway slave.","I don't care what you think.","I plan to steal him","and I need you to help.","Will you?\" Tom looked very excited.","\"I certainly will help.\"","I couldn't believe what I","had heard. I had always","thought very highly of Tom","and never dreamed that he","would help a runaway slave.","I never dreamed that he","would be an Abolitionist.","\"Are you joking, Tom?\"","\"No I'm not joking, Huck.\"","\"Remember, then, if you hear","anyone talking about a runaway","slave act as though you","know nothing about him.","I'll also act as though","I know nothing about Jim.\"","Tom put his bags into","my wagon and returned toward","the town while I returned","to the Phelps's house.","About a half hour later,","Tom's wagon arrived at the","Phelps's house. Aunt Sally saw","it through the window and","said, \"I wonder who that","could be? He appears to","be a stranger.\" Everyone ran","toward the front door.","Tom was on the front","porch and watched the man","turn his wagon around and","return toward the town.","Tom was wearing his best","clothes and I could sense","that he was planning an","act of some kind.","He lifted his hat and","bowed toward Silas Phelps and","said, \"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I assume.\"","\"No,\" said Mr. Phelps, \"I'm","sorry that your driver brought","you to the wrong house. Mr.","Nichols lives three miles from here.","But come into the house.\"","Tom looked down the road.","\"It's too late to call","my driver. He's gone.\"","\"Yes, he's gone. But please","come inside and eat your","dinner with us. Then I'll","drive you to the Nichols's farm.\"","\"Please come in,\" said Aunt Sally.","\"We've already put an extra","plate on the table.","There's plenty of food.\"","Tom thanked them in a","grand fashion and came into","the house. He told them","that his name was William","Thompson and that he was","from Hicksville, Ohio. He told","them many stories about Hicksville","and his family there.","Suddenly, he leaned toward Aunt","Sally and kissed her on","her mouth. She jumped up","in surprise, wiped her mouth,","and shouted, \"How dare you!\"","He looked sad and said,","\"I'm surprised that you did","not like my kiss.","I expected you to want","me to kiss you.\"","\"What made you think that","I would like it, you fool?\"","And she picked up a","wooden spoon and I was","certain that she was going","to hit him with it.","\"But they told me that","you would want me to","kiss you.\" \"Who told you?","Tell me their names before","I hit you with this spoon.\"","\"I'm sorry that I kissed you.","But everyone said that you","would like a kiss.","I won't kiss you again,","though, until you ask me to.\"","\"Until I ask you!","What makes you think that","I'll ever ask you?\"","Then he turned to me","and said, \"Tom, was I","wrong to expect Aunt Sally","to open her arms and","say to me, ‘Sid Sawyer—'","\" Hearing those words, Aunt","Sally jumped up and said,","\"You bad boy. I had","no idea.\" And she attempted","to kiss him. \"No kisses.","Not until you ask me first.\"","She quickly asked his permission.","\"My sister Polly told me","that only Tom would be coming.","She never said that she","would be sending you, also.\"","\"She never intended for both","of us to come.","I had to beg and","beg her for permission, and","only at the last minute","did she allow me to come.","While traveling on the boat,","Tom and I thought that","it would be a great","joke for him to arrive","at your house first, and","for me to arrive later","and act as though I","were a stranger. But that","was a mistake. This is","not a good place for","a stranger to come.\"","\"Not a place for strangers","with bad manners. I've not","been so upset by anyone","in years as I was","by your unexpected kiss.","But I don't mind.","I'm so very happy to","have you visit with us.\"","We ate a large dinner—there","was enough food on the","table for seven families—and all","the food was hot and","tasty, the best food that","I had ever eaten.","Later that afternoon, one of","the Phelps children said, \"Pa,","can Tom and Sid and","I go to the show?\"","\"No,\" said Mr. Phelps.","\"There won't be a show.","The runaway slave told me","how they had tricked men","in other towns. I told Mr.","Burton this, and he said","that he would tell other","men in town and I'm","certain that they have caught","those two men by now.\"","I felt very sad when","I heard this. I knew","that I had to warn","the king and duke.","Tom and I said that","we were tired and would","go to bed early.","As soon as we could,","we climbed out of the","bedroom window and jumped to","the ground. We were soon","walking quickly down the road","to the town. As we","walked, Tom told me how","my friends thought that I","had been murdered, and how","my Pap disappeared soon afterward","and was never seen again.","I told Tom about the","king and the duke and","about their foolish play.","When we reached the town,","we saw a crowd of","peo­ ple rushing down the","street, shouting and screaming and","making loud noises by hitting","sticks against large pans.","We jumped to the side","of the road to allow","them to pass, and as","they moved past us, I","could see the duke and","the king in the center","of this angry crowd.","They were cov­ ered with","feathers and a sticky black","substance called tar. They didn't","look human. I felt sick","to see them. I was","sorry for them even though","I knew how cruel they","had been. It was awful","to see them in this","con­ dition. Human beings can","be very cruel to one another.","We were too late.","I knew that we couldn't","help them. We asked some","people what had happened.","They told us that everyone","who had gone to the","show had been told in","advance about the trick the","king and the duke would","try to play. When the","king was doing his little","dance naked on the stage,","someone gave a signal and","all the men ran onto","the stage and seized them.","We slowly returned to the","Phelps's house. We were both","feeling very sad after what","we had seen. I was","feeling guilty, for some reason,","though I had done nothing wrong.","It seemed to make little","difference to me whether I","did right or wrong;","I always felt guilty.","I wished that I could","get rid of that part","of me that was forever","trying to decide what was","right and what was wrong.","It filled a big space","inside of me, but was","of little use to me.","Tom and I stopped talking","and started to think.","After a while, Tom said,","\"Huck, what fools we've been.","I think that I know","where Jim is.\" \"Where?\"","\"In that small cabin down","near the fence. When we","were eating dinner, I saw","a black slave walk down","there with some bowls of food.\"","\"I thought that he was","going to feed the dogs.\"","\"But he had fruit in","one of the bowls, and","dogs don't eat fruit.","I watched him unlock the","door of the cabin as","he went inside, and then","he locked it again before","he left. I'm certain that","a man is being held","prisoner inside, and that man","must be Jim. We need","to think of a plan","for stealing him.\" \"We can","easily discover if Jim is inside.","Then tomorrow night we can","row my canoe to the","island where I have my","raft hidden. The first dark","night, we can steal the","key from Mr. Phelps's trousers","pocket after he has gone","to sleep. We can unlock","the cabin door and free Jim.","Once we get him to","the raft, we can travel","south, hiding in the daytime","and traveling only at night.","Will this plan succeed?\"","\"Certainly it'll succeed. But your","plan is too simple.","A good plan will require","more work than that.","We have to think of","a plan that will give","people something to talk about","for years to come.\"","Tom then told me his","plan, and I could see","that his was worth fif­","teen of mine. His plan","had style and would make","Jim just as free a","man as my plan would","and might get us killed besides.","I was satisfied. I won't","tell his plan here because","I knew that he would","probably change it many times.","When we returned to the","Phelps's farm, we walked down","to the small cabin by","the fence. We found a","small, square window on the","back wall of the cabin.","A thick board was nailed","across the window. \"This window","is large enough for Jim","to get through if we","take the board off,\" I said.","\"That's so simple. I hope","that we can find a","more dif­ ficult way to","get Jim out. We're in","no hurry.\" Behind the cabin","was another small building joined","to it. We went into","this small building and saw","that it had no floor","at all—it was simply built","on the dirt ground.","\"We can dig him out,\"","said Tom. \"That should take","us a week.\" We walked","to the house and quietly","and carefully returned to our bedroom.","The next morning, we went","down the cabins where the","black slaves lived and talked","to the man who carried","the food to Jim—if it","was Jim who was being","held prisoner in that small cabin.","Tom said, \"What are you","going to do? Are you","going to feed the dogs?\"","The black slave smiled and","said, \"Yes, Master Sid, I'm","feeding a dog. An unusual dog.","Would you like to see","the dog?\" \"Yes.\" \"But Tom,\"","I whispered, \"that's not part","of our plan.\" \"Well, it's","our plan now.\" When we","entered the small cabin, we","could see nothing at all;","it was so dark inside.","But Jim was there and","he could see us.","He shouted, \"Huck! And Master","Tom, too!\" I knew that","this would happen. I expected it.","Now what were we going","to do? \"Does he know","you two gentlemen?\" asked the slave.","Tom looked at the black","slave and asked, \"Does who","know us?\" \"This runaway slave.\"","\"He's never seen us before","in his life. What caused","you to think that he","knew us?\" \"But he called","your names as if he","knew you well.\" Tom shook","his head as though he","were puzzled. \"Who called our names?","When did he speak?\"","then he turned to me","and said in a per­","fectly calm voice, \"Did you","hear anyone speak to us?\"","There was only one answer","I could give and so","I said, \"No, I heard","no one speak to us.\"","Then he turned to Jim,","looking at him as though","he had never seen him","before in his life, and","said, \"Did you speak to us?\"","\"No, sir,\" said Jim.","\"I said nothing, sir.\"","\"Not a word?\" \"No, sir,","not a word.\" \"Have you","ever seen us before in","your life?\" \"No, sir, never.\"","At last, Tom turned to","the black slave, who looked","very unhappy and frightened.","\"What's your problem? How can","you hear voices when no","one has spoken?\" \"It must","have been the devil.","The devil is always troubling me.","Please don't tell anyone about this.","Master Silas would be very","angry if he learned that","the devil was troubling me again.\"","Tom gave him ten cents","and said that he wouldn't","tell anyone. While the black","slave stepped to the door","to look at his ten","cents, Tom whispered to Jim,","\"Don't tell anyone that you","know us. If you hear","any­ one digging around your","cabin at night, that will","be us. We're going to","set you free.\" As soon","as we knew that everyone","was asleep that night, Tom","and I went down to","the small building behind Jim's cabin.","We closed the door and","began our digging. Tom said","that if we dug in","a certain place, our hole","would come up inside Jim's","cabin directly under his bed.","No one would be able","to see the hole because","the blankets on his bed","would cover it up.","We dug and dug for","many hours until we were","very tired. Our hands were","covered with sores, but we","had dug a large hole.","The next day, Tom stole","a spoon and a candleholder","from the house. He wanted","to make pens for Jim","out of these in the","manner of people that he","had read about in books.","He wanted Jim to write","mes­ sages using the pens","and his own blood.","Jim said that he would","be will­ ing to do","this if it would make","Tom happy. That night, we","returned to our digging.","After two and a half","hours the job was done.","We lay down on our","stomachs and pushed our way","through the narrow hole and","soon found we were under","Jim's bed in his cabin.","He was asleep but we","awakened him. He was so","happy to see us that","he almost cried. He wanted","us to help him escape","immediately, but Tom explained to","him how that would be","too simple, that he had","bet­ter plans that would be","like those he read about","in books, and assured him","that he would be free","in a short while if","he would just be patient.","Jim agreed to follow Tom's","plans, though he didn't understand","them very well. Jim assured","us that he was comfortable,","that he was being given","good food, and that Uncle","Silas came to talk with","him and pray with him","every day. Tom told Jim","how he wanted him to","write about his experiences using","the pens he would make","for him and in his","own blood. Jim said that","he didn't know how to","write and didn't see much","sense in doing it, but","if that was what white","folks did, he was willing","to try. In the morning,","Tom got an ax and","cut the candleholder into sev­","eral pieces. He went to","the slave cabins where Jim's","food was being pre­ pared","and hid the piece of","the candleholder inside of Jim's bread.","Then we went with the","black slave who took the","food to Jim. When Jim","bit into his bread, he","nearly knocked out his teeth,","but he acted as though","nothing had happened. Tom was","very pleased and thought that","this was exactly how people","acted in the books that","he read. While we were","watching Jim eat his breakfast,","several dogs came running into","the cabin from under Jim's bed.","They must have gotten into","the small building behind the","cabin and found the hole","we had dug. Soon the","cabin was filled with eleven","barking dogs. The black slave","screamed, \"Devils!\" and fell to","the floor. He cried and","acted like he was dying.","Tom opened the cabin door","and threw out a piece","of Jim's meat. The dogs","ran outside to eat the meat.","Then Tom talked to the","black slave lying on the floor.","He asked him what had","frightened him and if he","was imagining things again.","The black man answered, \"Master","Sid, you'll think that I'm","a fool, but I do","believe a million dogs or","devils or something were here","in this cabin a few","minutes ago.\" Tom shook his","head slowly as though he","had no idea what the","black man was talking about.","Making the pens was a","difficult job, but Jim said","that writing about his experiences","was going to be even","more difficult. Tom said that","he simply had to do","the writing; all prisoners that","Tom had read about in","books always wrote about their experiences.","\"I know that the writing","is going to be difficult,","but it must be done.","I'll write on paper what","I want you to copy","onto stone.\" \"But, Tom, where","are we going to get","a large stone to write on?\"","I asked. \"There's a large","grindstone down by the mill.","We'll steal it and move","it into Jim's cabin.","He can write on that.\"","Tom took a large piece","of paper and wrote these","lines for Jim to copy: 1.","Here a prisoner broke his heart.","2. Here a poor prisoner,","without friends, spent his sorrowful life.","3. Here a lonely, tired","prisoner died, after living alone","for thirty­ seven long years. 4.","Here, homeless and friendless, after","thirty­seven years of being kept","in this small cabin, a","noble stranger died. Tom read","these lines to us with","tears in his eyes.","At first, he want­ ed","me to choose only one","of the lines for Jim","to write on the grindstone.","But, he thought they were","all good and decided that","Jim should write them all.","It was nearly midnight when","Tom and I left Jim's","cabin and walked to the mill.","We stole the grindstone and","began to roll it toward","Jim's cabin. The grindstone was","very large and heavy.","Rolling it was very dif­","ficult because it kept falling over.","The stone was so heavy","that it was almost impossible","for the two of us","to lift it. When we","had rolled the grindstone half","the way to Jim's cabin,","we became so tired that","we couldn't move it further.","We knew that we had","to get Jim to help us.","We returned to his cabin","and told Jim our problem.","Jim's leg was chained to","a log of the bed,","but all we had to","do was raise the bed","and slip off the chain.","With Jim's help, we had","no problem getting the grindstone","to the cabin. Our hole","was quite large, but not","large enough to push the","grind­ stone through. Jim got","some tools and dug a","larger hole and soon we","had the grindstone inside.","Tom marked on the stone","some words for Jim to write.","Jim began to work by","the light of his candle","and contin­ ued until the","candle was completely burned out.","Then we slipped his chain","around the bed leg again","and told Jim that he","could go to sleep.","Suddenly, Tom thought of something.","\"Do you have any bugs","in here?\" \"No, I don't.\"","\"Then we have to get","you some.\" \"But I don't","want any bugs in here.","I don't like bugs.","I'm afraid of them.","I would rather have a","poisonous snake in here than bugs.\"","\"That's a good idea.","I'm sure that it's been","done in some book.","Where could you keep it?\"","\"Keep what, Tom?\" \"A poisonous snake.\"","\"A poisonous snake! If a","snake came in here, I","would break through that door","and leave in a hurry—even","if I had to use","my head to break through","the door.\" \"You wouldn't be","afraid of it after a while.","If you treated the snake","in a friendly manner, you'd","begin to like it.","The snake would begin to","love you, too, and want","to sleep with you.\"","\"Tom, I don't want a","snake to love me.","What the snake will do","is bite me.\" \"Can't you","at least try to live","with a poisonous snake?","All I'm ask­ ing is","for you to try.\"","\"But, I'll die if the","snake bites me. Then you","won't need to set me free.\"","\"If you refuse to cooperate,","we'll bring you a harmless snake.","We'll simply imagine that it's poisonous.\"","\"I could manage with a","harmless snake, but I would","far rather have no snake","at all. I never knew","that it would be so","difficult to be a prisoner.\"","\"It's difficult when it's done properly.","Do you have any rats","in here?\" \"No, I haven't","seen any rats.\" \"We'll get","you some rats, too.\"","\"But, Tom, I don't want","any rats. They might bite","my toes and awaken me","when I'm sleeping. You can","put a harmless snake in","here with me, but not rats.\"","\"But, Jim, you must have","rats—all prisoners have rats with them.","They teach the rats tricks","and become very friendly with them.","The rats will run over","you and have a good time.\"","\"I know that the rats","may have a good time,","but what kind of time","will poor Jim be having?","I don't know why rats","are needed, but I'll have","them here if I must.\"","Tom wanted to think of","other things for Jim to do.","\"Could you raise a flower","in here?\" \"I don't know.","It's very dark in here,","and a plant needs sunlight.","I don't need a flower","plant in here. It would","be too much trouble.\"","\"We'll bring you a small","plant, and you can water","it with your tears.\"","\"Why water it with my","tears when I can pour","water on it from my glass?\"","\"Prisoners have always watered their","plants with their tears.","That's the way that you","must do it.\" \"The plant","will die, Tom, because I","don't cry easily.\" Tom said","that Jim would have to","do the best that he could.","Jim complained about all the","work that he was being","asked to do—he didn't want","to raise the plant;","he didn't want to play","with rats; he didn't want","to sleep with a snake;","he didn't want bugs walking","over him; and he didn't","want to write on the","grindstone using his own blood","with the pen made out","of the candlestick. He said","that being a prisoner required","more responsibility and more work","than anything that he had","done before. Tom almost lost","patience with Jim. He said","that Jim had the oppor­","tunity to be a famous","prisoner, if only he did","things correctly, that Jim should","actually thank him for the","good ideas that he came","up with. Jim said that","he was sorry and that","he would try to be","grateful to Tom for helping","him do all the things","a prisoner is supposed to do.","Tom and I left the","cabin and returned to the","house and our beds.","IN THE MORNING, WE WALKED","TO THE TOWN AND BOUGHT","A SPECIAL box in which","to catch rats. We took","the box into the basement","and put it next to","the best rathole we knew of.","Within an hour, we had","caught fifteen large rats in","the box. We hid the","box under Aunt Sally's bed,","and then we went to","search for bugs. One of","Aunt Sally's small sons found","the box and opened it","to see if the rats","would come out. They did.","Aunt Sally entered the room","at that moment, jumped on","top of her bed, and","began screaming. Aunt Sally knew","that we had put the","rats in the box, and","she punished us. It took","us two hours to collect","fif­ teen new rats, but","they weren't as nice as","the first ones. We collected","a splendid group of bugs","and insects, and, last, we","looked for some harmless snakes.","They were easy to find,","and we soon had two","dozen snakes in a bag.","This time, we hid the","snakes in our room, but","when we returned after we","had eaten dinner, the bag","was empty. Not even one","snake was to be seen","in the room. We knew","that they had to be","in the house somewhere, and","we were certain that we","could catch some of them again.","There was no lack of","snakes around the house for","many days. We could see","them on the walls or","hanging from the lamps.","Some would fall onto the","table while we were eating","or fell down our backs.","They were handsome snakes and","quite harmless, but Aunt Sally","could not see the beauty","in them. She hated snakes;","she did not care whether","they were harmless or not.","When a snake fell onto","her neck, she would drop","whatever she was doing and","run screaming for help.","And when she found one","of them in her bed,","she would jump out of","bed and scream so loud","that you would think the","house was on fire.","Even after all the snakes","had been caught and taken","out of the house and","none had been seen for","a week, Aunt Sally was","still nervous. If she was","sit­ ting in her chair","thinking and I came near","her and touched her neck","with a feather, she would","jump out of her stockings.","We were punished each time","Aunt Sally was frightened by","one of the snakes.","I didn't object to the","punishment, but I did object","to our having to catch","a new group of snakes.","We finally had all the","snakes, rats, bugs, and other","insects that we needed, and","brought them to Jim's cabin.","Jim complained that there was","hardly space in the cabin","for him to move around.","He said that if he","ever got out of that","cabin, he wouldn't return to","being a prisoner again even","if we paid him.","By the end of three","weeks, we had everything ready","for Jim's escape. Tom said","that the last thing that","we had to do was","to write a letter to","the Phelpses warning them that","Jim might escape. I couldn't","believe what he had said.","\"Why would we want to","warn anyone? Let them discover","that Jim is gone once","we have escaped with him.\"","\"We can't expect Aunt Sally","and Uncle Silas to notice","all the trouble that we've","taken to do this correctly.","Unless we warn them that","someone plans to steal Jim,","the escape will be too easy.","All our work and trouble","will be useless if no","one notices.\" The next night,","Tom wrote the following letter,","and we put it on","Jim's cabin door: Don't tell","anyone what I have written here.","I wish to be your friend.","A group of criminals from","the Indian Territory are planning","to steal your runaway slave tonight.","I am one of this","group, but I don't want","to live with these criminals anymore.","I wish to live an","honest life, which is why","I am telling you of","this plan. They have a","key to the slave's cabin,","and will enter at midnight.","I am to watch for","danger, and if I see","someone approaching they have asked","me to blow on a","small horn. Instead, I will","make a sound like a","sheep to let you know","when they are all inside","the cabin. Then you can","quickly lock them inside and","kill them all. I do","not wish a reward;","I simply want to feel","that I have done the","right thing. Tom and I","spent the entire day in","my canoe on the river.","We checked the raft to","be sure that it would","be ready when we returned","late that night with Jim.","We returned to the Phelps's","house at suppertime, and found","the whole family acting in","a troubled manner. They didn't","tell us what was worrying","them, but they asked us","to go to bed immediately","after we fin­ ished eating.","Tom and I planned to","climb out of our bedroom","window and hurry to Jim's","cabin just as soon as","everyone had gone to bed.","But Tom asked me to","get some food to take","with us. As I went","down to the kitchen to","steal some food, Aunt Sally","saw me. \"What are you","doing down here?\" \"Nothing, Aunt Sally.\"","\"You must be down here","for something. What is it","that you want?\" \"I don't know.\"","\"Go into the living room","and wait for me.","I want to ask you","some questions. I'm busy at","the moment, but I'll be","free to speak to you soon.","I have this feeling that","you're down here for no","good reason and are going","to cause trouble again.\"","I walked into the living","room and found a crowd","of fifteen farmers sitting in there.","Each of them carried a gun!","I felt sick to my stomach.","I knew why they were there.","I wished that Aunt Sally","would punish me quickly, so","that I could rush upstairs","to warn Tom. When Aunt","Sally returned, she asked me","some questions, but I had","trouble listening to her.","I was too busy listening","to what the farm­ ers","were saying. Some said that","they thought everyone should wait","for the sheep signal.","Others said that they wanted","to get inside the cabin","first and wait for the criminals.","I nearly fainted. Suddenly, Aunt","Sally thought that I looked","sick and told me to","hurry upstairs to bed.","I ran upstairs in a","second and was soon out","the window and running through","the dark to Jim's cabin.","Tom was already there, and","I told him as quickly","as I could about the","fifteen men with guns waiting","in the house. Tom became","very excited and said, \"That's great.","If I were to plan","this again, I'm sure that","I would have two hundred men.","If we could put this","off—\" \"Hurry, Tom. Where's Jim?\"","\"He's standing next to you","in the dark. Everything has","been done, and we can","now escape with him.\"","But then we heard the","sound of men outside the cabin.","We could hear them testing","the door to see if","it was locked. \"I told","you that we would arrive","too soon. They haven't come.","The door's locked. I'll unlock it.","Some of you wait inside","in the dark. Kill them","when they come. Others must","hide outside and listen.","They'll warn those inside when","they hear the criminals approaching.\"","Some men came inside but","couldn't see us in the dark.","We quick­ ly jumped under","the bed, and quietly left","through the hole that we","had dug. Soon we were","inside the small building next","to the cabin, and we","could hear men outside.","We opened the door just","a little, but could see","nothing because it was very dark.","We listened and listened for","a long time, and then","Tom said that it was","safe for us to leave","if we were very quiet.","We walked safely to the","fence, and Jim and I","were quickly over the fence,","but Tom's trousers got caught","on a fence board.","The board broke when he","pulled himself free. \"Who's there?","Answer, or I'll shoot.\"","But we didn't answer.","We simply ran. We heard","men running and the bang! bang!","bang! of their guns.","\"They're running toward the river.","Catch them. Don't let them escape.","Let the dogs catch them.\"","We could hear their heavy","shoes running after us.","They couldn't hear us because","we didn't wear shoes.","The dogs ran past us","and were not interested in","us because they knew us;","they were the Phelps's dogs","that we played with all","the time. The dogs ran","on, searching for strangers.","We reached the canoe and","soon rowed to our raft.","When we finally got onto","the raft, I said, \"Jim,","you're a free man.","You won't be a slave","ever again.\" \"That was a","beautiful escape, Huck. It was","planned beautifully and it was","done beautifully. There's no one","who could have thought of","a plan that was more","splendid than that one.\"","We were all happy to","be on the raft, but","no one was happier than Tom.","He said that he was","happy to finally get to","sit down. He had been","shot in the leg!","Suddenly, Jim and I didn't","feel as happy as we","had felt before. Tom's leg","pained him very much, and","we could see that it","was bleed­ ing. We tore","off the duke's shirts into","long strips and wrapped these","around the leg to stop","the blood. Tom didn't want","us to worry about his","leg and kept shouting for","us to untie the raft","and start down the river.","But Jim and I talked","quietly to each other about","this new prob­ lem, and","finally Jim said, \"We'll not","leave this place until you","see a doctor, Tom.","If you were the slave","and I were the free","man who had been shot","in the leg, I know","that you would do the","same for me.\" I knew","that Jim was white on","the inside, and I knew","that he would say what","he did. I told Tom","that I was going to","get a doctor, and though","Tom objected, Jim and I insisted.","I left in the canoe","to get a doctor.","The Doctor was an old","man, a very nice, kind-looking","old man. I told him","that my brother and I","had been hunting on an","island in the river and","that he had dropped his","gun, which accidentally shot him","in the leg. I told","him that we wanted him","to go to the island","to look at the leg,","but that we didn't want","our family to know of","the acci­ dent. He acted","as though he didn't quite","believe my story, but he","took a light and followed","me to my canoe.","When he saw the size","of the canoe, he said","that it was too small","for the two of us","and insisted on going alone.","I stayed on shore and","soon fell asleep behind a","pile of wood. When I","awakened, the sun was high","in the sky. I ran","to the doctor's house to","ask him about Tom, but","his wife told me that","he had gone away during","the night and had not returned.","I thought that must mean","that Tom was very sick","and I was determined to","get to the raft.","As I hurried toward the","river, I suddenly met Uncle Silas.","He said, \"Tom, where have","you been all night?","We were worried about you.\"","\"Sid and I were hunting","for that runaway slave.\"","\"Where did you go?","Your aunt has been very worried.\"","\"She need not have worried.","We're fine. We looked for","the run­ away all night.","Sid is at the post","office now hoping to hear","news of him.\" Uncle Silas","and I walked to the","post office to find Sid,","but, as I sus­ pected,","he was not there.","We waited, but Sid didn't come.","The old man insisted that","I walk home with him","and said that Sid could","follow later. When we got","home, Aunt Sally was very","happy to see me.","The house was filled with","farmers eating dinner and talking","about what had happened the","night before. They kept discussing","how the black slave must","have been crazy to have","written those strange words on","the grind­ stone. \"And how","did he get that grindstone","inside the cabin?\" \"And who","dug that hole?\" \"He couldn't","have done any of those","things without help.\" \"Did you","see the pen made from","the candleholder?\" \"Who sawed off","the leg of his bed?\"","\"A dozen men must have","helped him—no, forty men—a dozen","couldn't have done all that.","All the black slaves on","this farm must have helped him.","And Sid and Tom were","watching all the time, and","never saw anything happening.\"","Later that afternoon, when all","the farmers and their wives","had gone home, Aunt Sally","finally remembered about me and","wanted to know where I","had been. \"And where's Sid?\"","I told her the same","lie that I had told","Uncle Silas, about how Sid","and I had looked for","the runaway slave. \"It's nearly","night, and Sid hasn't come home.","Where is that boy?\"","\"I'll run into town to","get him,\" I said.","\"No, you won't. One boy","lost is enough. Uncle Silas","will go to look for him.\"","When Uncle Silas returned at","ten o'clock that night, he","had not found Sid.","He told Aunt Sally not","to worry, that Sid would","surely be home in the morning.","I went to bed early,","but Aunt Sally came upstairs","to my room and sat","on my bed. She talked","to me for a long","time and said what a","splen­did boy I was and","what a splendid boy Sid was.","She didn't want to stop","talking about Sid. She was","sure that he was lying","hurt somewhere or maybe even dead.","She wanted to be near","him to help. She cried","softly as she talked, with","tears on her face.","She kissed me and told","me to sleep well and","not to climb out the window.","\"The door won't be locked,","Tom, but you'll be good","and stay in­ side, won't you?","To please me.\" I wanted","to please her very badly,","but I knew that I","had to see what was","happening with Tom. I really","intended to go to Tom,","but I felt so sad","about Aunt Sally that I","just could not disappoint her.","Twice during the night I","climbed out my window and","went around to the front","of the house and saw","Aunt Sally sitting at a","window watching the road.","I wished that I could","do something to help her,","but I could not.","All I could do was","to promise myself that I","would not make her unhappy again.","Uncle Silas went to town","early the next morning -","before breakfast. No one had","seen Tom. Silas returned to","the house very sad and worried.","He and Aunt Sally sat","at the table unable to","eat anything. Finally, Silas said,","\"Here's a letter that came yesterday.","I forgot to give it","to you.\" Aunt Sally looked","at the letter. \"It's from","my sister Polly. She must","be writing to ask about","Sid and Tom.\" I began","to feel very uncomfortable and","was prepared to run from","the room, when Aunt Sally","shouted, \"Look! Outside there!\"","The doctor was walking down","the road, followed by a","crowd of people. Someone was","carrying Tom, and Jim was","being led with his hands","tied behind his back.","Tom turned to look at","Aunt Sally, and she cried,","\"He's alive! Thank God!\"","Then she ran to the","house to get his bed prepared.","I followed the men to","see what they were planning","to do with Jim, while","Uncle Silas and the doctor","went into the house with Tom.","Some men wanted to hang","Jim as an example to","other slaves who might try","to run away. But others","said that it would not","be right. If Jim's owner","were to come to claim","him, there might be problems","if he were dead.","They returned Jim to his","cabin again and put a","chain around his leg.","Jim never said a word","and acted as though he","didn't know me. Later, the","doctor came out to the","cabin and told the men","not to be rough with Jim.","\"He's a good man.","When I found the boy,","he was too sick to","move and I knew that","I needed help to care","for his leg prop­ erly.","As soon as I told","the boy that I was","going to need help, this","black man came out from","a hiding place and said","that he would help me.","And he did help and","did a very good job","of helping. I never knew","a person who was a","better nurse than he.","He lost his freedom by helping.","I like that black man.","He's worth a thousand dollars","and deserves kind treatment.\"","The men promised to treat","Jim kindly and all agreed","that he was a good person.","I felt thankful to that","old doctor for doing a","favor for Jim. I was","happy that the doctor agreed","with my feelings about Jim—","from the first moment that","I met Jim, I knew","that he had a good","heart and was a good man.","I knew that I had","much to explain to Aunt","Sally and didn't know what","I should tell her about","how Tom was shot in","the leg. I avoided her","as much as I could,","but that was easy to","do since she spent all","her time at Tom's bedside.","The next day, I was","told that Tom was a","little better and that Aunt","Sally had finally gone to","her own room to sleep.","I went in to speak","to Tom, but I found","him sleeping peacefully. I watched","Tom sleep for a long","time, but was afraid to","awaken him. Later that day,","Aunt Sally came in to","sit with me. She whispered","how we could all be","happy now that the worst","part of Tom's illness had ended.","He had been talking in","a crazy manner when the","doctor first brought him home,","but she was cer­ tain","that his mind would be","clear when he awakened.","We sat by the bed","watching Tom sleep. Suddenly, he","began to move a little","and then he opened his eyes.","He looked around the room","and said, \"Hello! I'm at home!","Where's the raft?\" \"Everything's fine,\"","I assured him. \"How's Jim?\"","\"The same.\" I tried to","sound like I was telling","the truth, but my voice","didn't sound natural. Tom didn't notice.","\"Good! Splendid! We're all safe.","Did you tell Aunt Sally?\"","I wanted to quiet Tom,","but I was too late.","Aunt Sally spoke. \"Tell Aunt","Sally what, Sid?\" \"About the","way the whole thing was done.\"","\"What whole thing, Sid?\"","\"There's only one whole thing.","Did he tell you how","we helped the runaway slave escape?\"","\"What's he talking about?","Is he talking crazy again?\"","\"No, I'm not talking crazy.","I know what I'm saying.","We did help the slave","escape, and we did it","in a grand manner.\"","Once Tom started talking, I","knew I couldn't make him stop.","He told Aunt Sally everything—about","the weeks and weeks we","spent planning and working, how","we never slept at night,","how we moved the grindstone","and made the pens, about","the snakes and the bugs","and the rats. And finished","by saying, \"You can't imagine","what fun we had.\"","\"I never heard such a","story in all my life.","I can't believe that it","was you two who have","made all the trouble for","us and frightened us nearly","to death. You get all","the enjoyment you can out","of this now, but if","I find you helping him","again—\" \"Helping who?\" Tom asked.","\"The runaway slave. Certainly you","know who I mean.\"","Tom looked at me sadly","and said, \"I thought that","you told me everything was fine.","Is he on the raft?\"","\"The runaway slave? No, he's","locked in that cabin again,\"","said Aunt Sally. \"We'll keep","him until his owner comes","to get him.\" \"You have","no right to keep him","a prisoner. Let him go","free imme­ diately. He's no slave;","he's as free as any","man who walks on this earth.\"","\"What do you mean?\"","\"I mean every word that","I have spoken, Aunt Sally.","I have known him all","my life and so has Tom.","He belonged to old Miss","Watson, and she died two","months ago. She felt such","great shame when she remem­bered","how she had threatened to","sell him down to New","Orleans that she left a","letter setting him free.\"","\"Then why did you go","through all that trouble to","set him free if he","was already free?\" \"Don't you","understand anything, Aunt Sally?","I wanted the adven- ture,","that's why. I would have","been happy—why, Aunt Polly!","What are you doing here?\"","Aunt Polly was standing there,","right in the room.","I could not believe my eyes.","Quickly, I hid under Tom's bed.","After Aunt Polly had kissed","Aunt Sally several times, she","turned toward the bed and","said, \"What do you have","to say about all this, Tom?\"","\"Oh! Has he changed that much?","That's Sid, not Tom.","Tom is— where is Tom?","He was here a minute ago.\"","\"You mean, where's Huck Finn?","I should be able to","recognize Tom Sawyer when I","see him. Come out from","under the bed, Huck Finn.\"","So I came out.","Aunt Sally couldn't understand what","was happening. She had to","be told several times before","she would believe Aunt Polly.","Then Uncle Silas had to","be told and he, too,","had trouble understanding it all.","I said that I had","not planned to act as","though I were Tom, but","that when Aunt Sally assumed","that's who I was the","very first day that she","met me, I could never","figure out how to tell","her the truth. And when","Tom Sawyer arrived, I knew","that he would love the","mystery and adventure, and he","was happy to act as","though he were Sid.","Aunt Polly said that Tom","was correct; Miss Watson had","set Jim free before she died.","And that Tom Sawyer had","gone through all that trouble","and all that pain to","set a free slave free!","I had wondered how Tom,","good citizen that he was,","could have helped a runaway","slave, but now I understood.","Tom was not an Aboli­ tionist.","Aunt Polly said that when","Aunt Sally wrote to her","that Tom and Sid had","arrived safely, she knew that","something was wrong. \"The only","way that I could discover","the trouble Tom was in","this time was to travel","the 1,100 miles down the","river—especially since you didn't answer","my letters.\" \"What letters?","I didn't get any letters","from you.\" \"Tom, what did","you do with those letters?\"","Tom looked very uncomfortable and","said, \"They're in my bag.","I didn't open them and","haven't read any of them.","I thought that you were","in no hurry—\" \"Tom Sawyer,","you need to be punished.","But I wrote a third","letter saying that I was coming.","The letter is not here","in Tom's bag.\" \"Oh, it","came yesterday, but I never","read it.\" We had Jim","out of the chains and","out of that cabin immediately.","Aunt Polly, Aunt Sally, and","Uncle Silas were good to","him and invited him to","visit Tom in his bedroom","and gave him good food","to eat. Tom gave Jim","forty dollars for being such","a good prisoner. Jim was","very pleased and said, \"Huck,","I told you when we","began our trip that I","was rich before and would","be rich again. Now that","has come true.\" Tom talked","and talked and said that","the three of us should","now buy horses and travel","to the Indian Territory and","live a life of much","adventure for a few weeks.","I said that would be","fine, but I had no money.","I said that I was","sure that I couldn't get","money from Judge Thatcher because","Pap must have all the","money by now. Tom said,","\"Your Pap doesn't have your","money, Huck. Judge Thatcher still","has all of it.","Your Pap hasn't been seen","since the day you disappeared.\"","Jim looked at me sadly","and said, \"He's never returning, Huck.\"","\"How do you know, Jim?\"","\"Do you remember that house","we found floating on the river?","There was a dead man","in that house. I looked","carefully at his face, and","the man was your Pap.\"","Tom's feeling well now, and","there's nothing more to write","about, and I'm happy to stop.","If I had known what","trouble it was to make","a book, I would not","have begun the job.","I may leave for the","Indian Terri­ tory without waiting","for Tom and Jim because","Aunt Sally wants to make","me her son and raise","me in a proper manner,","and I cannot endure that.","I've been there before."]
